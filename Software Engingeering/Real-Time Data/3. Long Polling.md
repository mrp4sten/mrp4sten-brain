[[Real time data]]

Long polling is a technique where the client polls the server for new data. However, if the server does not have any data available for the client, instead of sending an empty response, the server holds the request and waits for some specified period of time for new data to be available. If new data becomes available during that time, the server immediately sends a response to the client, completing the open request. If no new data becomes available and the timeout period specified by the client expires, the server sends a response indicating that fact. The client will then immediately re-request data from the server, creating a new request-response cycle.

So-called “long polling” is a much better way to poll the server.
It’s also very easy to implement, and delivers messages without delays.
The flow:

1. A request is sent to the server.
2. The server doesn’t close the connection until it has a message to send.
3. When a message appears – the server responds to the request with it.
4. The browser makes a new request immediately.
