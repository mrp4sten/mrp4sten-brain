[[Real time data]]
Server-Sent Events (SSE) is a technology for sending real-time updates from a server to a web client over a single, persistent HTTP connection. It enables servers to push updates to clients efficiently and automatically reconnects if the connection is lost. SSE is ideal for applications needing one-way communication, such as live notifications or real-time data feeds, and uses a simple text-based format for transmitting event data, which can be easily handled by clients using the `EventSource` API in JavaScript.
