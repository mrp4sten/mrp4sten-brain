Container security encompasses a broad set of practices and tools aimed at protecting containerized applications from development through deployment and runtime. It involves securing the container image, ensuring that only trusted and non-vulnerable code is used, implementing strong access controls for container environments, and configuring containers to follow the principle of least privilege. Additionally, it includes monitoring for unexpected behavior, protecting communication between containers, and maintaining the host environmentâ€™s security. Effective container security integrates seamlessly into DevSecOps workflows to provide continuous visibility and protection across the container lifecycle without disrupting development speed or agility.

## Image security
Image security is a crucial aspect of deploying Docker containers in your environment. Ensuring the images you use are secure, up to date, and free of vulnerabilities is essential.
Docker Content Trust (**DCT**) provides the ability to use digital signatures for data sent to and received from remote Docker registries. These signatures allow client-side or runtime verification of the integrity and publisher of specific image tags. [Docker trust](https://docs.docker.com/engine/security/trust/)
## Runtime security
Runtime security in Docker focuses on ensuring the safety and integrity of containers during their execution, safeguarding against vulnerabilities and malicious activities that could arise while the containerized application is running. This involves monitoring container behavior for anomalies, implementing access controls to limit permissions, and employing tools to detect and respond to suspicious activity in real time. Effective runtime security also ensures that only verified images are deployed and continuously audits the system to maintain compliance, thereby providing a robust defense layer to prevent exploits and maintain the desired security posture throughout the container lifecycle.
