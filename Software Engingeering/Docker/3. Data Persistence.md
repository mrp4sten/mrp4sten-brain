[[1. Docker]]

Data persistence in docker enables you to run containers that are isolated pieces of code, including applications and their dependencies, separated from the host operating system. Containers are ephemeral by default, which means any date stored in the container will be lost once it is terminated. To overcome this problem and retain data across container lifecycle, Docker provides various data persistence methods.
## Ephemeral FS 
By default, the storage within a Docker container is ephemeral, meaning that any data changes or modifications made inside a container will only persist as long as the container is running. Once the container is stopped and removed, all the associated data will be lost. This is because Docker containers are designed to be stateless by nature. This temporary or short-lived storage is called the “ephemeral container file system”. It is an essential feature of Docker, as it enables fast and consistent deployment of applications across different environments without worrying about the state of a container.
## Volume mounts
Volume mounts are a way to map a folder or file on the host system to a folder or file inside a container. This allows the data to persist outside the container even when the container is removed. Additionally, multiple containers can share the same volume, making data sharing between containers easy.
## Bind mounts
Bind mounts have limited functionality compared to volumes. When you use a bind mount, a file or directory on the host machine is mounted into a container. The file or directory is referenced by its absolute path on the host machine. By contrast, when you use a volume, a new directory is created within Docker’s storage directory on the host machine, and Docker manages that directory’s contents.
