[[1. Docker]]

Third-party images are pre-built Docker container images that are available on Docker Hub or other container registries. These images are created and maintained by individuals or organizations and can be used as a starting point for your containerized applications.
## Databases
Running your database in a Docker container can help streamline your development process and ease deployment. Docker Hub provides numerous pre-made images for popular databases such as MySQL, PostgreSQL, and MongoDB.
## Interactive test environments with docker
Docker allows you to create isolated, disposable environments that can be deleted once youâ€™re done with testing. This makes it much easier to work with third party software, test different dependencies or versions, and quickly experiment without the risk of damaging your local setup.
## CLI utilities
Docker images can include command line utilities or standalone applications that we can run inside containers.
