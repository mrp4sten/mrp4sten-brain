# Whats docker? 
Docker is an open-source platform that automates the deployment, scaling, and management of applications by isolating them into lightweight, portable containers. Containers are standalone executable units that encapsulate all necessary dependencies, libraries, and configuration files required for an application to run consistently across various environments.
## What are containers? 
Containers are lightweight, portable, and isolated software environments that allow developers to run and package applications with their dependencies, consistently across different platforms. They help to streamline application development, deployment, and management processes while ensuring that applications run consistently, regardless of the underlying infrastructure.
## Need for containers
Containers solve the issue around inconsistent environments when working in large teams. Before containers or virtual environments, a lot of issues and time loss was caused by having to install and configure local environments to build projects shared by co-workers or friends.
## Docker and OCI
The Open Container Initiative (OCI) is a Linux Foundation project which aims at creating industry standards for container formats and runtimes. Its primary goal is to ensure the compatibility and interoperability of container environments through defined technical specifications.
# Underlying Technologies
## LXC (Linux Containers)
Enables running multiple applications independent linux systems on a single computer. Acting as isolated spaces, LXC containers share host resources like mamory and processing power, without needing their own full operating system copy, ensuring lightweight and fast startup.
## cgroups (Control groups)
cgroups or “control groups” are a Linux kernel feature that allows you to allocate and manage resources, such as CPU, memory, network bandwidth, and I/O, among groups of processes running on a system. It plays a crucial role in providing resource isolation and limiting the resources that a running container can use.
## UnionFS (Union file systems)
Union file systems, also known as UnionFS, play a crucial role in the overall functioning of Docker. It’s a unique type of filesystem that creates a virtual, layered file structure by overlaying multiple directories. Instead of modifying the original file system or merging directories, UnionFS enables the simultaneous mounting of multiple directories on a single mount point while keeping their contents separate. This feature is especially beneficial in the context of Docker, as it allows us to manage and optimize storage performance by minimizing duplication and reducing the container image size.
## Namespaces
Docker namespaces are a fundamental feature of Linux that Docker uses to create isolated environments for containers. They provide a layer of isolation by creating separate instances of global system resources, making each container believe it has its own unique set of resources. Docker utilizes several types of namespaces, including PID (Process ID), NET (Network), MNT (Mount), UTS (Unix Timesharing System), IPC (InterProcess Communication), and USER namespaces and by leveraging these namespaces, Docker can create lightweight, portable, and secure containers that run consistently across different environments.
