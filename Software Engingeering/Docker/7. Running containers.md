[[1. Docker]]

Running docker containers is typically done with a simple `docker run` command, which is a combination of the `docker create` and `docker start` commands.
The `docker run` command creates and starts a new container from a specified image. It combines `docker create` and `docker start` operations, offering a range of options to customize the container’s runtime environment. Users can set environment variables, map ports and volumes, define network connections, and specify resource limits. The command supports detached mode for background execution, interactive mode for shell access, and the ability to override the default command defined in the image. Common flags include `-d` for detached mode, `-p` for port mapping, `-v` for volume mounting, and `--name` for assigning a custom container name. Understanding `docker run` is fundamental to effectively deploying and managing Docker containers.
## Docker compose
Docker Compose is a tool for defining and running multi-container Docker applications. It allows you to create, manage, and run your applications using a simple YAML file called `docker-compose.yml`. This file describes your application’s services, networks, and volumes, allowing you to easily run and manage your containers using just a single command.
## Runtime configuration options
Docker runtime configuration options give you powerful control over your containers’ environments. By tweaking resource limits, network settings, security profiles, and logging drivers, you can optimize performance and enhance security. You’ll also find options for setting environment variables, mounting volumes, and overriding default behaviors – all crucial for tailoring containers to your specific needs. For more advanced users, there are tools to adjust kernel capabilities and set restart policies. Whether you’re using command-line flags or Docker Compose files, these options help ensure your containers run smoothly and consistently, no matter where they’re deployed.
### Key Categories of Runtime Configuration Options:
1. **Resource Limits**:
    - Control the resources allocated to a container.
    - Examples:
        - `--memory`: Limit the memory usage (e.g., `--memory=512m`).
        - `--cpus`: Restrict CPU usage (e.g., `--cpus=1.5`).
2. **Networking**:
    - Manage how a container connects to networks.
    - Examples:
        - `--network`: Specify the network mode (e.g., `--network=bridge`).
        - `--publish` or `-p`: Map container ports to host ports (e.g., `-p 8080:80`).
3. **Storage**:
    - Configure how data is stored and shared.
    - Examples:
        - `--volume` or `-v`: Mount volumes (e.g., `-v /host/path:/container/path`).
        - `--tmpfs`: Mount a temporary filesystem (e.g., `--tmpfs /app/cache`).
4. **Environment Variables**:
    - Pass environment-specific settings to a container.
    - Examples:
        - `--env` or `-e`: Set environment variables (e.g., `-e ENV=production`).
5. **Runtime Privileges and Security**:
    - Adjust security settings for a container.
    - Examples:
        - `--privileged`: Grant extended privileges to a container.
        - `--user`: Run the container as a specific user (e.g., `--user 1000:1000`).
6. **Process Management**:
    - Configure how the containerized application runs.
    - Examples:
        - `--entrypoint`: Override the default entrypoint.
        - `--workdir` or `-w`: Set the working directory inside the container.
7. **Logging**:
    - Configure logging options.
    - Examples:
        - `--log-driver`: Specify the logging driver (e.g., `--log-driver=json-file`).
        - `--log-opt`: Set log driver options.
###  `ENTRYPOINT`
- **Purpose**: Defines the main command that always executes when the container starts.
- **Behavior**:
    - It's fixed and cannot be overridden easily during `docker run` (unless you use the `--entrypoint` flag).
    - Often used for applications that need a specific executable to always run (e.g., a script or binary).
- **Syntax**:
    - Shell form: `ENTRYPOINT command param1 param2`
    - Exec form (recommended): `ENTRYPOINT ["executable", "param1", "param2"]`
### `CMD`
- **Purpose**: Provides default arguments or commands for the container's main process.
- **Behavior**:
    - It can be overridden when running the container with `docker run <image> <custom_command>`.
    - If used with `ENTRYPOINT`, `CMD` provides additional arguments to `ENTRYPOINT`.
- **Syntax**:
    - Shell form: `CMD command param1 param2`
    - Exec form (recommended): `CMD ["executable", "param1", "param2"]`
