[[Software Engineering]]

Set of solutions that have been proven to work well for specific types of software systems. They provide a common vocabulary and set of best practices for designing and building software systems, and can help developers make better design decisions.
- Model-View-Controller (MVC): A pattern for separating the user interface, business logic, and data storage components of a system.
- Microservices: A pattern for building systems as a collection of small, independently deployable services that communicate over a network.
- Event-Driven: A pattern for building systems that respond to events and perform actions in response.
- Layered: A pattern for organizing a system into layers, with each layer providing a specific set of services to the layer above it.
- Pipe-and-Filter: A pattern for building systems as a series of independent, reusable processing elements that are connected together in a pipeline.
- Command-Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS): A pattern for separating the handling of commands (which change the state of the system) from the handling of queries (which retrieve information from the system)
- Blackboard: A pattern for creating a centralized repository of information that can be accessed and modified by multiple independent modules or subsystems.
- Microkernel: A pattern that aims to minimize the amount of code running in kernel mode and move as much functionality as possible into user-mode processes.
- Serverless: A design pattern that allows developers to build and run applications and services without having to provision and manage servers.
- Message Queues and Streams: A pattern that decouples different components of a system and enables asynchronous communication between them.
- Event Sourcing: A pattern that stores all changes to the system’s state as a sequence of events, rather than just the current state.

## CQRS
**Command Query Responsibility Segregation** is an architectural pattern that is used to separate the responsability of reading and writing data in software system. [[Command Query Responsability Segregation]]
## SOA
[[3. SOA]] is an architectural pattern that is used to design and organize software systems as collection of services that can be accessed over a network, these services are autonomus, self-contained units of functionality that can be reused and combined to create a new functionality.
## Domain-Driven Design
[[Domain-Driven design]] is used to design software systems based on the core business domain and business entities, its focused on creating a clear and accurate representation of the business domain within the software system, and on aligning the software system with the business goals and objectives.
## Microservices
[[2. Microservices]]  is an architectural pattern that is used to design software systems as a collection of small, independent, and loosely-coupled services. Each service is responsible for a specific functionality and can be developed, deployed, and scaled independently. The main advantage of a microservices architecture is that it allows for a more flexible and scalable system, it also improves fault isolation and enables faster deployment. It’s often used in combination with other architectural patterns and styles such as event-driven architecture, CQRS, and service-oriented architecture.
## Blackboard Pattern
The Blackboard architectural pattern is a software design pattern that allows for the creation of a centralized repository of information that can be accessed and modified by multiple independent modules or subsystems. The blackboard serves as a communication and coordination mechanism between these modules, allowing them to share information and collaborate to achieve a common goal. This pattern is often used in artificial intelligence and decision-making systems, where multiple processes or agents need to share and reason over complex data.

## Microkernel
A microkernel is an architectural pattern in operating system design that aims to minimize the amount of code running in kernel mode (i.e., privileged mode with direct access to hardware resources) and instead move as much functionality as possible into user mode. This is done by providing a small, minimalistic core kernel that only handles basic tasks such as memory management, process scheduling, and inter-process communication (IPC), and leaving all other functionality to be implemented in user-mode processes.

## Serverless
[[4. Serverless]] architecture is a design pattern that allows developers to build and run applications and services without having to provision and manage servers. Instead, these applications and services are executed in a fully managed environment, such as AWS Lambda, Azure Functions, or Google Cloud Functions, where the infrastructure and scaling are handled automatically by the cloud provider.
## Message Queues Streams
Message queues and streams are architectural patterns that are used to decouple different components of a system and enable asynchronous communication between them.
Message Queues: A message queue is a software component that allows multiple systems or applications to communicate with each other by passing messages between them. Messages are stored in a queue, and each message is processed by a single consumer. This pattern is useful for systems where there is a high degree of variability in the rate of message production and consumption, and where the sender and receiver do not need to be active at the same time. Examples of message queue systems are Apache Kafka, RabbitMQ, and Amazon SQS.

## Event sourcing
[[Event Sourcing]] is an architectural pattern that is used to build systems that need to maintain a history of all the changes that have occurred over time. This pattern stores all changes to the system’s state as a sequence of events, rather than just the current state.
