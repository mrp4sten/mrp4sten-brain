Architectural principles refer to a set of guidelines or rules that are used to guide the design and development of a software architecture. These principles are intended to ensure that the resulting architecture is maintainable, scalable, and easy to understand and modify. Some common architectural principles include the separation of concerns, modularity, loose coupling, and high cohesion. Additionally, architectural principles are often used in conjunction with design patterns, which are reusable solutions to common software design problems.

## Component principles
Component principles in software architecture refer to guidelines for designing and implementing software components that are modular, reusable and easy to understand, test, and maintain. 
Key component principles:
- High cohesion
- Low coupling
- Separation of concerns
- Interface-based design
- Reausability
- Testability
- Modularity
- Interoperability
By following these component principles, software can be developed in a way that is easy to understand, maintain, and extend, and that is less prone to bugs. It also enables better code reuse, and makes it easier to test and change the code, and also enables better code reusable, as components can be reused in different contexts.

## What is a component?
A component is a modular, portable, replaceable an reusable set of well-defined functionality that encapsulates its implementation and exporting it as a higher-level interface.
Is a software object, intended to interact with other components, encapsulating certain functionality or a set of functionalities. Can be defined as a unit of composition with a contractually specified interface and explicit context dependencies only, can be deployed independently and is subject to composition by third parties.
### Views of a component
- Object-oriented view: A component is viewed as a set of one or more cooperating classes.
- Conventional view: It is a viewed as a functional element or a module of a program that integrates the processing logic, the internal data structured that are required to implement the processing logic and an interface that enables the component to be invoked and data to be passed to it.
- Process-related view: Instead of creating each component from scratch, the system is building from existing components mainained in a library. As the software architecture is formulated, components are selected from the library and used to populate the architecture.

## Policy vs detail
The distinction between policy and detail refers to the separation of high-level decisions and low-level implementation details.
- Policy: High-level decisions that define the overall behavior and structure of the system
- Detail: Low-level implementation details that are required to implement the policy decisions. Including specific algorithms, data structures and code that make up the systems components.
## Coupling and cohesion
- Coupling refers to the degree to which one component depends on another component. High coupling means that a change in one component will likely affect other components. Low coupling is basically the instead of High coupling.
- Cohesion refers to the degree to which the responsibilities of a components are related to each other. High cohesion means that a components has a single, well-defined purpose and its functionality and data is related to that purpose. Low cohesion means that a component has multiple, unrelated, responsibilities, making it more difficult to understand and maintain. 
## Boundaries
Interfaces or the points of separation between different components or system. These boundaries can be physical, such as between different microservices in a distribuited system, or logical, such as between different layers of application.
