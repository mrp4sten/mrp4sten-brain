A programming paradigm is a fundamental style or approach to solving problems using a programming language. Different programming paradigms provide different ways of organizing and structuring code, and have different strengths and weaknesses.

## Structured programming
A programming paradigm is a fundamental style or approach to solving problems using a programming language. Different programming paradigms provide different ways of organizing and structuring code, and have different strengths and weaknesses.
## Functional programming
Functional programming is a programming paradigm that emphasizes the use of pure functions and immutable data. It is a way of writing computer programs that emphasizes the use of functions and mathematical concepts, such as recursion, rather than using objects and classes like in object-oriented programming. In functional programming, functions are first-class citizens, which means they can be passed as arguments to other functions and returned as values.
Functional programming encourages immutability, which means that once a variable is assigned a value, it cannot be changed. This can simplify code, as it eliminates the need for state management and the bugs that can come with it.
## Object oriented programming
Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that is based on the concept of “objects”, which are instances of classes. OOP is a way of organizing and structuring code that is based on the principles of encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism.
Encapsulation refers to the idea that an object’s internal state should be hidden and accessible only through its methods. This allows the object to control how its data is used and prevents external code from making invalid changes to the object’s state.
