Refer to the overall design and organization of a software system, and the principles and patterns that are used to guide the design.
Some common architectural styles in software include:
- Microservices: where the system is built as a collection of small, independent, and loosely-coupled services.
- Event-Driven: where the system reacts to specific events that occur, rather than being continuously polled for changes.
- Layered: where the system is divided into a set of layers, each of which has a specific responsibility and communicates with the other layers through well-defined interfaces.
- Service-Oriented: where the system is built as a collection of services that can be accessed over a network.
- Data-Centric: where the system is focused on the storage, retrieval and manipulation of data, rather than the processing of data.
- Component-Based: where the system is composed of reusable and independent software components.
- Domain-Driven: where the system is organized around the core business domain and business entities.
## Messaging
Is a powerful concept that allows for the decoupling and scalability of systems and its used in different architectural styles to improve the flexibility and scalability of the system by allowing for loose coupling between components and making its easier to add new features or modify existing ones.
### Publish subscribe or Observer pattern 
The publish-subscribe pattern is a messaging pattern in which a publisher sends a message to a topic, and any number of subscribers can subscribe to that topic to receive the message.

### Event-Driven
**EDA** is a software design pattern in which the system reacts to specific events that occur, rather than being continuously polled for changes. In EDA, events are messages that are sent asynchronously between components, and the components react to events they are interested in.

## Distributed
Refer to the design and organization of software components that are distributed across multiple devices or locations, connected via a network, and work together to achieve a common goal.
### Client-Server
Is a architecture pattern where a client or multiple clients send requests to a server, and the server responds to those requests.

### Peer-to-peer
**P2P** architecture in the network act as both a client and a server. There is no central authority or server that manages the network, and each node communicates directly with other nodes to exchange information, share resources, and perform computations.

## Structural
Refers to the organization and design of the components of a software system, and how they interact with each other. It deals with the physical organization of the system, and the relationships between the different components.
### Component based
**CBD** is an approach to designing software systems by composing them from a set of resusable and idnependent software component. These component encapsulate specific functionality and can be easily integrated into different parts of the system, allowing for a more modular and flexible design.

### Monolithic
In software architecture, monolithic architecture is a design approach in which a software system is built as a single, integrated, and self-contained unit.
### Layered
In software architecture, layered architecture is a design approach in which a software system is divided into a set of layers, each of which has a specific responsibility and communicates with the other layers through well-defined interfaces. This approach allows for a more modular and flexible design, where each layer can be developed, tested, and deployed independently, making it easier to add new features, modify existing ones, and maintain the system.
