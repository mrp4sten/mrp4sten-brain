The `DROP TABLE` statement is a Data Definition Language (DDL) operation that is used to **completely remove** a table from the database. This operation deletes the table structure along with **all the data in** it, effectively removing the table from the database system.

When you execute the `DROP TABLE` statement, it eliminates both the table and its data, as well as any associated indexes, constraints, and triggers. Unlike the `TRUNCATE TABLE` statement, which only removes data but keeps the table structure, `DROP TABLE` removes everything associated with the table.
