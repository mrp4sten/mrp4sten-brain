# Primary Key

A primary key in SQL is a unique identifier for each record in a database table. It ensures that each row in the table is uniquely identifiable, meaning no two rows can have the same primary key value. A primary key is composed of one or more columns, and it must contain unique values without any `NULL` entries. The primary key enforces entity integrity by preventing duplicate records and ensuring that each record can be precisely located and referenced, often through foreign key relationships in other tables. Using a primary key is fundamental for establishing relationships between tables and maintaining the integrity of the data model.

# Foreign Key

A foreign key in SQL is a column or group of columns in one table that refers to the primary key of another table. It establishes a link between two tables, enforcing referential integrity and maintaining relationships between related data. Foreign keys ensure that values in the referencing table correspond to valid values in the referenced table, preventing orphaned records and maintaining data consistency across tables. They are crucial for implementing relational database designs and supporting complex queries that join multiple tables.

# Unique

`UNIQUE` is a constraint in SQL used to ensure that all values in a column or a set of columns are distinct. When applied to a column or a combination of columns, it prevents duplicate values from being inserted into the table. This constraint is crucial for maintaining data integrity, especially for fields like email addresses, usernames, or product codes where uniqueness is required. `UNIQUE` constraints can be applied during table creation or added later, and they automatically create an index on the specified column(s) for improved query performance. Unlike `PRIMARY KEY` constraints, `UNIQUE` columns can contain `NULL` values (unless explicitly disallowed), and a table can have multiple `UNIQUE` constraints.

# NOT NULL

The `NOT NULL` constraint in SQL ensures that a column cannot have a NULL value. Thus, every row/record must contain a value for that column. It is a way to enforce certain fields to be mandatory while inserting records or updating records in a table.

For instance, if you’re designing a table for employee data, you might want to ensure that the employee’s `id` and `name` are always provided. In this case, you’d use the `NOT NULL` constraint.

# CHECK

A `CHECK` constraint in SQL is used to enforce data integrity by specifying a condition that must be true for each row in a table. It allows you to define custom rules or restrictions on the values that can be inserted or updated in one or more columns. `CHECK` constraints help maintain data quality by preventing invalid or inconsistent data from being added to the database, ensuring that only data meeting specified criteria is accepted.
