# BEGIN

`BEGIN` is used in SQL to start a transaction, which is a sequence of one or more SQL operations that are executed as a single unit. A transaction ensures that all operations within it are completed successfully before any changes are committed to the database. If any part of the transaction fails, the `ROLLBACK` command can be used to undo all changes made during the transaction, maintaining the integrity of the database. Once all operations are successfully completed, the `COMMIT` command is used to save the changes. Transactions are crucial for maintaining data consistency and handling errors effectively.

# COMMIT

The SQL COMMIT command is used to save all the modifications made by the current transaction to the database. A COMMIT command ends the current transaction and makes permanent all changes performed in the transaction. It is a way of ending your transaction and saving your changes to the database.

After the SQL COMMIT statement is executed, it can not be rolled back, which means you can’t undo the operations. COMMIT command is used when the user is satisfied with the changes made in the transaction, and these changes can now be made permanent in the database.

# ROLLBACK

`ROLLBACK` is a SQL command used to undo transactions that have not yet been committed to the database. It reverses all changes made within the current transaction, restoring the database to its state before the transaction began. This command is crucial for maintaining data integrity, especially when errors occur during a transaction or when implementing conditional logic in database operations. `ROLLBACK` is an essential part of the ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) properties of database transactions, ensuring that either all changes in a transaction are applied, or none are, thus preserving data consistency.

# SAVEPOINT

A `SAVEPOINT` in SQL is a point within a transaction that can be referenced later. It allows for more granular control over transactions by creating intermediate points to which you can roll back without affecting the entire transaction. This is particularly useful in complex transactions where you might want to undo part of the work without discarding all changes. `SAVEPOINT` enhances transaction management flexibility.

# ACID

ACID are the four properties of relational database systems that help in making sure that we are able to perform the transactions in a reliable manner. It’s an acronym which refers to the presence of four properties: atomicity, consistency, isolation and durability

- **Atomicity**: the “all or nothing” rule — the transaction either happens completely or doesn’t happen at all
- **Consistency**: data is consistent before and after a transaction without any missing steps
- **Isolation**: multiple transactions can happen concurrently without reading the wrong data
- **Durability**: transactional success is robust to system failure

# Transaction Isolation Levels

Transaction isolation levels in SQL define the degree to which the operations in one transaction are visible to other concurrent transactions. There are typically four standard levels: Read Uncommitted, Read Committed, Repeatable Read, and Serializable. Each level provides different trade-offs between data consistency and concurrency. Understanding and correctly setting isolation levels is crucial for maintaining data integrity and optimizing performance in multi-user database environments.
