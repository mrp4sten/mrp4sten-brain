Transactions in SQL are units of work that group one or more database operations into a single, atomic unit. They ensure data integrity by following the ACID properties: Atomicity (all or nothing), Consistency (database remains in a valid state), Isolation (transactions donâ€™t interfere with each other), and Durability (committed changes are permanent). Transactions are essential for maintaining data consistency in complex operations and handling concurrent access to the database.
