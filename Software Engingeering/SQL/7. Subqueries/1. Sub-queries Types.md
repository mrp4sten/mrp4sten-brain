# Table

A table is a fundamental structure for organizing data in a relational database. It consists of rows (records) and columns (fields), representing a collection of related data entries. Tables define the schema of the data, including data types and constraints. They are the primary objects for storing and retrieving data in SQL databases, and understanding table structure is crucial for effective database design and querying.

# Row

In SQL, a row (also called a record or tuple) represents a single, implicitly structured data item in a table. Each row contains a set of related data elements corresponding to the tableâ€™s columns. Rows are fundamental to the relational database model, allowing for the organized storage and retrieval of information. Operations like INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE typically work at the row level.

# Column

In SQL, columns are used to categorize the data in a table. A column serves as a structure that stores a specific type of data (ints, str, bool, etc.) in a table. Each column in a table is designed with a type, which configures the data that it can hold. Using the right column types and size can help to maintain data integrity and optimize performance.

# Scalar

A scalar value is a single data item, as opposed to a set or array of values. Scalar subqueries are queries that return exactly one column and one row, often used in `SELECT` statements, `WHERE` clauses, or as part of expressions. Scalar functions in SQL return a single value based on input parameters. Understanding scalar concepts is crucial for writing efficient and precise SQL queries.
