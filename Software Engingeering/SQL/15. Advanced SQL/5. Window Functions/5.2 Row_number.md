# Row_number

ROW_NUMBER() is a SQL window function that assigns a unique, sequential integer to each row within a partition of a result set. Itâ€™s useful for creating row identifiers, implementing pagination, or finding the nth highest/lowest value in a group. The numbering starts at 1 for each partition and continues sequentially, allowing for versatile data analysis and manipulation tasks.

```sql
ROW_NUMBER() OVER (
[PARTITION BY expr1, expr2,...] ORDER BY expr1 [ASC | DESC], expr2,... )
```
