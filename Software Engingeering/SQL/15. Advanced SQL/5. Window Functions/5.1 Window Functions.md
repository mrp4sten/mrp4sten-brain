SQL Window functions enable you perform calculations on a set of rows related to the current row. This set of rows is known as a ‘window’, hence ‘Window Functions’.

These are termed so because they perform a calculation across a set of rows which are related to the current row - somewhat like a sliding window.

```sql
SELECT column1, column2, 
       window_function() OVER (PARTITION BY column1 ORDER BY column2) AS result
FROM table_name;
```
