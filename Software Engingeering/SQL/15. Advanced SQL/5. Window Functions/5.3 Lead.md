# lead

`LEAD` is a window function in SQL that provides access to a row at a specified offset after the current row within a partition. It’s the counterpart to the `LAG` function, allowing you to look ahead in your dataset rather than behind. `LEAD` is useful for comparing current values with future values, calculating forward-looking metrics, or analyzing trends in sequential data. Like `LAG`, it takes arguments for the column to offset, the number of rows to look ahead (default is 1), and an optional default value when the offset exceeds the partition’s boundary.

```sql
LEAD(column1_name, offset) OVER(
  ORDER BY column2_name
)
```
