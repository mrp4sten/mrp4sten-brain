Dynamic SQL is a programming method that allows you to build SQL statements dynamically at runtime. It allows you to create more flexible and adaptable applications because you can manipulate the SQL statements on the fly, in response to inputs or changing conditions.

Consider an application where a user can choose multiple search conditions from a range of choices. You might not know how many conditions the user will choose, or what they’ll be until runtime. With static SQL, you would have to include a large number of potential search conditions in your WHERE clause. With dynamic SQL, you can build the search string based on the user’s actual choices. Note that while the use of Dynamic SQL offers greater flexibility, it also comes with potential security risks such as SQL Injection, and should be used judiciously. Always validate and sanitize inputs when building dynamic queries.

```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION get_employees_by_department(dept_name TEXT)
RETURNS TABLE (employee_id INT, name TEXT, department TEXT, salary NUMERIC) AS $$
DECLARE
    query TEXT;
BEGIN
    -- Construct the dynamic SQL query as a string
    query := 'SELECT employee_id, name, department, salary FROM employees WHERE department = ' || quote_literal(dept_name);

    -- Execute the dynamic SQL query and return the result set
    RETURN QUERY EXECUTE query;
END $$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;

```
