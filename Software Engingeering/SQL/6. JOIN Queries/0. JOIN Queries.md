SQL `JOIN` queries combine rows from two or more tables based on a related column between them. There are several types of JOINs, including INNER JOIN (returns matching rows), `LEFT JOIN` (returns all rows from the left table and matching rows from the right), `RIGHT JOIN` (opposite of `LEFT JOIN`), and `FULL JOIN` (returns all rows when thereâ€™s a match in either table). `JOIN`s are fundamental for working with relational databases, allowing users to retrieve data from multiple tables in a single query, establish relationships between tables, and perform complex data analysis across related datasets.
