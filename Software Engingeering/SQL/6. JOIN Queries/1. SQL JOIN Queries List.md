# INNER JOIN

An `INNER JOIN` in SQL is a type of join that returns the records with matching values in both tables. This operation compares each row of the first table with each row of the second table to find all pairs of rows that satisfy the join predicate.

Few things to consider in case of `INNER JOIN`:

- It is a default join in SQL. If you mention `JOIN` in your query without specifying the type, SQL considers it as an `INNER JOIN`.
- It returns only the matching rows from both the tables.
- If there is no match, the returned is an empty result.

# LEFT JOIN

A `LEFT JOIN` in SQL returns all rows from the left (first) table and the matching rows from the right (second) table. If there’s no match in the right table, `NULL` values are returned for those columns. This join type is useful when you want to see all records from one table, regardless of whether they have corresponding entries in another table. `LEFT JOIN`s are commonly used for finding missing relationships, creating reports that include all primary records, or when working with data where not all entries have corresponding matches in related tables.

# RIGHT JOIN

A `RIGHT JOIN` in SQL is a type of outer join that returns all rows from the right (second) table and the matching rows from the left (first) table. If there’s no match in the left table, `NULL` values are returned for the left table’s columns. This join type is less commonly used than LEFT JOIN but is particularly useful when you want to ensure all records from the second table are included in the result set, regardless of whether they have corresponding matches in the first table. `RIGHT JOIN` is often used to identify missing relationships or to include all possible values from a lookup table.

# FULL OUTER JOIN

A `FULL OUTER JOIN` in SQL combines the results of both `LEFT` and `RIGHT OUTER JOIN`s. It returns all rows from both tables, matching records where the join condition is met and including unmatched rows from both tables with `NULL` values in place of missing data. This join type is useful when you need to see all data from both tables, regardless of whether there are matching rows, and is particularly valuable for identifying missing relationships or performing data reconciliation between two tables.

# Self Join

A `SELF JOIN` is a standard SQL operation where a table is joined to itself. This might sound counter-intuitive, but it’s actually quite useful in scenarios where comparison operations need to be made within a table. Essentially, it is used to combine rows with other rows in the same table when there’s a match based on the condition provided.

It’s important to note that, since it’s a join operation on the same table, alias(es) for table(s) must be used to avoid confusion during the join operation.

# Cross Join

The cross join in SQL is used to combine every row of the first table with every row of the second table. It’s also known as the Cartesian product of the two tables. The most important aspect of performing a cross join is that it does not require any condition to join.

The issue with cross join is it returns the Cartesian product of the two tables, which can result in large numbers of rows and heavy resource usage. It’s hence critical to use them wisely and only when necessary.
