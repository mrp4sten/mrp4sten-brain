Creating views in SQL involves using the `CREATE VIEW` statement to define a virtual table based on the result of a `SELECT` query. Views donâ€™t store data themselves but provide a way to present data from one or more tables in a specific format. They can simplify complex queries, enhance data security by restricting access to underlying tables, and provide a consistent interface for querying frequently used data combinations. Views can be queried like regular tables and are often used to encapsulate business logic or present data in a more user-friendly manner.
