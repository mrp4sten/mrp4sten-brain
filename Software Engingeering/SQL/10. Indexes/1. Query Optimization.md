Query optimization in SQL involves refining queries to enhance their execution speed and reduce resource consumption. Key strategies include indexing columns used in `WHERE`, `JOIN`, and `ORDER BY` clauses to accelerate data retrieval, minimizing data processed by limiting the number of columns selected and filtering rows early in the query. Using appropriate join types and arranging joins in the most efficient order are crucial. Avoiding inefficient patterns like `SELECT`, replacing subqueries with joins or common table expressions (CTEs), and leveraging query hints or execution plan analysis can also improve performance. Regularly updating statistics and ensuring that queries are structured to take advantage of database-specific optimizations are essential practices for maintaining optimal performance.
