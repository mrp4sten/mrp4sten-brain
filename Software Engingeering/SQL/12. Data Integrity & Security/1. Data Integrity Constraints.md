SQL constraints are used to specify rules for the data in a table. They ensure the accuracy and reliability of the data within the table. If there is any violation between the constraint and the action, the action is aborted by the constraint.

Constraints are classified into two types: column level and table level. Column level constraints apply to individual columns whereas table level constraints apply to the entire table. Each constraint has its own purpose and usage, utilizing them effectively helps maintain the accuracy and integrity of the data.

In essence, integrity constraints are crucial for:

- Preventing missing data.
- Ensuring all data adheres to the expected types and value ranges.
- Maintaining proper links between data across different tables.
