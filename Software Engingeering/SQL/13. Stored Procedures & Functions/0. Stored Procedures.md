- [[Relational Data Bases and SQL]]

Stored procedures and functions are precompiled database objects that encapsulate a set of SQL statements and logic. Stored procedures can perform complex operations and are typically used for data manipulation, while functions are designed to compute and return values. Both improve performance by reducing network traffic and allowing code reuse. They also enhance security by providing a layer of abstraction between the application and the database.

Here’s a quick breakdown of stored procedure features:

1. **Encapsulation**: Groups SQL statements and logic, making it easier to maintain and reuse code.
2. **Efficiency**: Procedures are often precompiled, which can speed up repeated executions.
3. **Security**: Permissions can be set on procedures, limiting data access for users.
4. **Modularity**: Code is centralized, allowing changes in the procedure without altering client applications.
5. **Reduced Traffic**: As procedures are executed on the database server, there’s less data transfer between the server and client.

## Differences with Functions

### 1. **Purpose and Use Case**

- **Stored Procedures**: Typically used to perform a series of actions on the database, such as modifying data (e.g., `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`) or managing transactions. They can include complex business logic and workflows.
- **Functions**: Mainly used to perform calculations or return a single value. They are often used in SQL queries to perform operations on data, but functions usually don’t modify the database state.

### 2. **Return Type**

- **Stored Procedures**: Can return multiple result sets or no result at all. They don’t have to return a value directly but can use `OUTPUT` parameters if needed.
- **Functions**: Must return a single value or a table (in the case of table-valued functions). The return type is mandatory and defined explicitly when the function is created.

### 3. **Syntax**

- **Stored Procedures**: Created with the `CREATE PROCEDURE` statement. They don’t require a `RETURN` statement but can use `RETURN` to stop execution at any point.
- **Functions**: Created with the `CREATE FUNCTION` statement and require a `RETURN` statement to specify the value or table being returned.

### 4. **Usage in SQL Statements**

- **Stored Procedures**: Cannot be used directly in SQL statements like `SELECT`. They need to be executed with the `EXEC` or `CALL` statement.
- **Functions**: Can be called directly within SQL statements (e.g., `SELECT`, `WHERE`, `ORDER BY`), which makes them more versatile for data retrieval and calculations.

### 5. **Ability to Modify Data**

- **Stored Procedures**: Can execute any kind of SQL statements, including `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`, and other operations that modify data.
- **Functions**: Generally, they are restricted to read-only operations. In most databases, functions cannot modify data (some exceptions exist, but modifying data within functions is discouraged).

### 6. **Transaction Control**

- **Stored Procedures**: Can begin, commit, and roll back transactions, allowing more complex control over data integrity.
- **Functions**: Cannot handle transactions or include transactional control statements like `BEGIN TRANSACTION`, `COMMIT`, or `ROLLBACK`.

### 7. **Error Handling**

- **Stored Procedures**: Can include more advanced error handling with `TRY...CATCH` blocks (in SQL Server, for instance).
- **Functions**: Error handling is usually limited, and any errors within a function will typically result in the function terminating without advanced handling.
