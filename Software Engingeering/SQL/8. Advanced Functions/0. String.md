# CONCAT

`CONCAT` is an SQL function used to combine two or more strings into a single string. It takes multiple input strings as arguments and returns a new string that is the concatenation of all the input strings in the order they were provided. `CONCAT` is commonly used in `SELECT` statements to merge data from multiple columns, create custom output formats, or generate dynamic SQL statements.

# LENGTH

The `LENGTH` function in SQL returns the number of characters in a string. It’s used to measure the size of text data, which can be helpful for data validation, formatting, or analysis. In some database systems, `LENGTH` may count characters differently for multi-byte character sets. Most SQL dialects support `LENGTH`, but some may use alternative names like LEN (in SQL Server) or `CHAR_LENGTH`. This function is particularly useful for enforcing character limits, splitting strings, or identifying anomalies in string data.

# SUBSTRING

SUBSTRING is a SQL function used to extract a portion of a string. It allows you to specify the starting position and length of the substring you want to extract. This function is valuable for data manipulation, parsing, and formatting tasks. The exact syntax may vary slightly between database systems, but the core functionality remains consistent, making it a versatile tool for working with string data in databases.

# REPLACE

The `REPLACE` function in SQL is used to substitute all occurrences of a specified substring within a string with a new substring. It takes three arguments: the original string, the substring to be replaced, and the substring to replace it with. If the specified substring is found in the original string, `REPLACE` returns the modified string with all instances of the old substring replaced by the new one. If the substring is not found, the original string is returned unchanged. This function is particularly useful for data cleaning tasks, such as correcting typos, standardizing formats, or replacing obsolete data.

# UPPER

UPPER() is a string function in SQL used to convert all characters in a specified string to uppercase. This function is particularly useful for data normalization, case-insensitive comparisons, or formatting output. UPPER() typically works on alphabetic characters and leaves non-alphabetic characters unchanged. It’s often used in SELECT statements to display data, in WHERE clauses for case-insensitive searches, or in data manipulation operations. Most SQL databases also provide a complementary LOWER() function for converting to lowercase. When working with international character sets, it’s important to be aware of potential locale-specific behavior of UPPER().

# LOWER

The `LOWER` function in SQL converts all characters in a specified string to lowercase. It’s a string manipulation function that takes a single argument (the input string) and returns the same string with all alphabetic characters converted to their lowercase equivalents. `LOWER` is useful for standardizing data, making case-insensitive comparisons, or formatting output. It doesn’t affect non-alphabetic characters or numbers in the string. `LOWER` is commonly used in data cleaning, search operations, and ensuring consistent data representation across different systems.
