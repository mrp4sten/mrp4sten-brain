# CASE

The CASE statement in SQL is used to create conditional logic within a query, allowing you to perform different actions based on specific conditions. It operates like an if-else statement, returning different values depending on the outcome of each condition. The syntax typically involves specifying one or more WHEN conditions, followed by the result for each condition, and an optional ELSE clause for a default outcome if none of the conditions are met.

# NULLIF

`NULLIF` is an SQL function that compares two expressions and returns NULL if they are equal, otherwise it returns the first expression. It’s particularly useful for avoiding division by zero errors or for treating specific values as `NULL` in calculations or comparisons. `NULLIF` takes two arguments and is often used in combination with aggregate functions or in `CASE` statements to handle special cases in data processing or reporting.

# COALESCE

`COALESCE` is an SQL function that returns the first non-null value in a list of expressions. It’s commonly used to handle null values or provide default values in queries. `COALESCE` evaluates its arguments in order and returns the first non-null result, making it useful for data cleaning, report generation, and simplifying complex conditional logic in SQL statements.
