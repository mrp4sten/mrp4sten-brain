`MIN` is an aggregate function in SQL that returns the lowest value in a set of values. It works with numeric, date, or string data types, selecting the minimum value from a specified column. Often used in conjunction with `GROUP BY`, `MIN` can find the smallest value within each group. This function is useful for various data analysis tasks, such as identifying the lowest price, earliest date, or alphabetically first name in a dataset.
