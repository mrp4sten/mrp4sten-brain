# Data Types

SQL data types define the kind of values that can be stored in a column and determine how the data is stored, processed, and retrieved. Common data types include numeric types (`INTEGER`, `DECIMAL`), character types (`CHAR`, `VARCHAR`), date and time types (`DATE`, `TIMESTAMP`), binary types (`BLOB`), and boolean types. Each database management system may have its own specific set of data types with slight variations. Choosing the appropriate data type for each column is crucial for optimizing storage, ensuring data integrity, and improving query performance.
