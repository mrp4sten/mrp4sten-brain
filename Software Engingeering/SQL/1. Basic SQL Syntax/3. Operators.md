SQL operators are symbols or keywords used to perform operations on data within a database. They are essential for constructing queries that filter, compare, and manipulate data. Common types of operators include arithmetic operators (e.g., `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`), which perform mathematical calculations; comparison operators (e.g., `=`, `!=`, `<`, `>`), used to compare values; logical operators (e.g., `AND`, `OR`, `NOT`), which combine multiple conditions in a query; and set operators (e.g., `UNION`, `INTERSECT`, `EXCEPT`), which combine results from multiple queries. These operators enable precise control over data retrieval and modification.
