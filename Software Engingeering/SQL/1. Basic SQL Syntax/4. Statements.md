# SELECT statement

SELECT is one of the most fundamental SQL commands, used to retrieve data from one or more tables in a database. It allows you to specify which columns to fetch, apply filtering conditions, sort results, and perform various operations on the data. The SELECT statement is versatile, supporting joins, subqueries, aggregations, and more, making it essential for data querying and analysis in relational databases.

# Insert

The “INSERT” statement is used to add new rows of data to a table in a database. There are two main forms of the INSERT command: `INSERT INTO` which, if columns are not named, expects a full set of columns, and `INSERT INTO table_name (column1, column2, ...)` where only named columns will be filled with data.

# Delete

DELETE is an SQL statement used to remove one or more rows from a table. It allows you to specify which rows to delete using a WHERE clause, or delete all rows if no condition is provided. DELETE is part of the Data Manipulation Language (DML) and is used for data maintenance, removing outdated or incorrect information, or implementing business logic that requires data removal. When used without a WHERE clause, it empties the entire table while preserving its structure, unlike the TRUNCATE command.

# UPDATE

The UPDATE statement in SQL is used to modify existing records in a table. It allows you to change the values of one or more columns based on specified conditions. The basic syntax includes specifying the table name, the columns to be updated with their new values, and optionally, a WHERE clause to filter which rows should be affected. UPDATE can be used in conjunction with subqueries, joins, and CTEs (Common Table Expressions) for more complex data modifications. It’s important to use UPDATE carefully, especially with the WHERE clause, to avoid unintended changes to data. In transactional databases, UPDATE operations can be rolled back if they’re part of a transaction that hasn’t been committed.
