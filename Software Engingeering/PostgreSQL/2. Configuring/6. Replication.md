Replication, in simple terms, is the process of copying data from one database server to another.

### Types of Replication:

1. **Streaming Replication**:
    
    - **How it Works**: The primary server continuously streams **WAL (Write-Ahead Logging)** changes to standby servers in real time.
    - **Use Case**: Provides **hot standby** servers that are read-only but can quickly take over if the primary server fails.
    - **Synchronous vs. Asynchronous**:
        - **Asynchronous**: Default setting where standbys may lag behind the primary.
        - **Synchronous**: Ensures that at least one standby has confirmed receiving the data before the primary commits the transaction, providing zero data loss at the cost of some latency.
2. **Logical Replication**:
    
    - **How it Works**: Streams only data changes (inserts, updates, deletes) on a per-table basis rather than the entire WAL.
    - **Use Case**: Useful for selective replication, data integration, and replication between different PostgreSQL versions. Supports **logical decoding** for custom data transformations.
3. **Physical Replication**:
    
    - A lower-level form of replication where the entire database cluster is copied from the primary to the standby using WAL files.
    - **Base Backup**: Typically required for setting up a standby server for physical replication.
