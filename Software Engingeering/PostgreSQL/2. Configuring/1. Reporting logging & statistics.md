When working with PostgreSQL, it is often useful to analyze the performance of your queries and system as a whole. This can help you optimize your database and spot potential bottlenecks. One way to achieve this is by reporting logging statistics. PostgreSQL provides configuration settings for generating essential logging statistics on query and system performance.
#### **Log Destinations**

PostgreSQL allows you to specify where logs are stored, using the `log_destination` setting:

- **stderr**: Default option, writes logs to standard error.
- **csvlog**: Outputs logs in CSV format, useful for easy parsing and analysis.
- **syslog**: Sends logs to the systemâ€™s syslog service.
- **jsonlog**: Outputs logs in JSON format, making it easy to integrate with structured logging systems.

```sql
# Example setting
log_destination = 'stderr, csvlog'
```
#### **Log Format Options**

Configure additional settings for log formats:

- **logging_collector**: If enabled, logs are written to files instead of the console.
- **log_filename**: Sets the name for log files (e.g., `postgresql-%Y-%m-%d.log`).
- **log_rotation_age** and **log_rotation_size**: Controls log file rotation by time or file size.
- **log_timezone**: Sets the time zone for log timestamps.

```sql
logging_collector = on
log_filename = 'postgresql-%a.log'  # rotates daily
log_rotation_age = 1d               # daily rotation
log_rotation_size = 100MB           # or by size
```

#### **Log Levels and Types**

PostgreSQL lets you log various levels and types of messages:

- **log_min_messages**: Controls minimum log level (e.g., `DEBUG`, `INFO`, `NOTICE`, `WARNING`, `ERROR`, `LOG`, `FATAL`, `PANIC`).
- **log_statement**: Logs the type of SQL statements (`none`, `ddl`, `mod`, or `all`).
- **log_duration** and **log_min_duration_statement**: Logs the duration of each query; useful for identifying slow queries.
- **log_connections** and **log_disconnections**: Logs when a user connects or disconnects from the database.

```sql
log_min_messages = 'warning'
log_statement = 'all'  # log all queries
log_duration = on
log_min_duration_statement = 500  # log queries taking over 500 ms
log_connections = on
log_disconnections = on
```

#### **Other Useful Logging Options**

- **log_error_verbosity**: Controls the verbosity of error messages (`TERSE`, `DEFAULT`, or `VERBOSE`).
- **log_lock_waits**: Logs when queries wait on a lock longer than a specified time.
- **log_temp_files**: Logs temporary file usage for queries requiring disk storage.
- **log_autovacuum_min_duration**: Logs autovacuum operations that take longer than the specified time.

```sql
log_lock_waits = on
log_temp_files = 0  # log all temporary file usage
log_autovacuum_min_duration = 1000  # log autovacuum over 1 sec
```

#### **pg_stat Activity Views**

PostgreSQL provides built-in **pg_stat views** for accessing real-time and cumulative statistics:

- **pg_stat_activity**: Shows the current activity for each session (queries being run, connections, wait events, etc.).
- **pg_stat_user_tables** and **pg_stat_user_indexes**: Provides access statistics on tables and indexes (scans, tuples fetched, updates, etc.).
- **pg_stat_bgwriter**: Contains statistics on background writer activity (buffers written, checkpoints, etc.).

```sql
SELECT * FROM pg_stat_activity;         -- Current session activity
SELECT * FROM pg_stat_user_tables;      -- Table usage statistics
SELECT * FROM pg_stat_user_indexes;     -- Index usage statistics
```

#### **pg_stat_statements Extension**

- **pg_stat_statements** is a popular extension for logging and analyzing the execution of SQL statements. It provides cumulative statistics on execution time, call count, rows processed, and more, making it essential for identifying slow and frequent queries.
- To enable this extension:
```sql
CREATE EXTENSION pg_stat_statements;
```

#### **pg_statio Views**

The `pg_statio` family of views provides detailed I/O statistics for tables and indexes:

- **pg_statio_user_tables**: I/O statistics for tables (heap blocks read, hits, etc.).
- **pg_statio_user_indexes**: I/O statistics for indexes (index blocks read, hits, etc.).

```sql
SELECT * FROM pg_statio_user_tables;    -- Table I/O statistics
SELECT * FROM pg_statio_user_indexes;   -- Index I/O statistics
```
