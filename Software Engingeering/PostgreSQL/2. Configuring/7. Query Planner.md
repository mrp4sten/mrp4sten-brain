The PostgreSQL query planner is an essential component of the system that’s responsible for optimizing the execution of SQL queries. It finds the most efficient way to join tables, establish subquery relationships, and determine the order of operations based on available data, query structure, and the current PostgreSQL configuration settings.

The task of the _planner/optimizer_ is to create an optimal execution plan. A given SQL query (and hence, a query tree) can be actually executed in a wide variety of different ways, each of which will produce the same set of results

### Key Steps of the Query Planner

1. **Parsing and Query Tree Creation**:
    
    - When a SQL query is received, PostgreSQL parses it and converts it into a **query tree**, which is a structured, internal representation of the query’s components (tables, columns, conditions, etc.).
2. **Planning and Cost Estimation**:
    
    - The planner evaluates various execution strategies for accessing and joining tables, filtering rows, and sorting or grouping results.
    - For each potential plan, PostgreSQL assigns a **cost estimate** based on factors like:
        - **Sequential scans** vs. **Index scans**: Access methods that affect performance depending on data size, indexes, and the number of matching rows.
        - **Join strategies**: Determines whether to use nested loops, hash joins, or merge joins based on the size of tables, indexes, and conditions.
        - **Disk I/O and CPU usage**: Considers resources needed to read data and perform calculations.
3. **Join Methods**:
    
    - The planner chooses the most efficient join method, which might vary based on data distribution, indexes, and table sizes:
        - **Nested Loop Join**: Best for small tables or when one table has a small subset of matching rows.
        - **Hash Join**: Effective for larger tables where one can be hashed, reducing comparisons for matching rows.
        - **Merge Join**: Works well with sorted input on join keys, reducing comparison operations.
4. **Cost-Based Optimization**:
    
    - PostgreSQL assigns each potential plan a **cost value** (a lower cost indicates a more efficient plan).
    - It uses a **cost-based optimization** model to weigh all plans, choosing the one with the lowest estimated cost as the optimal plan.
    - Cost is calculated based on:
        - Estimated number of rows affected
        - Disk I/O (page fetches)
        - CPU cycles for comparisons, computations, etc.
5. **Final Plan Selection**:
    
    - After evaluating multiple possible execution plans, the planner selects the one with the lowest estimated cost, which is then sent to the executor for actual query processing.
