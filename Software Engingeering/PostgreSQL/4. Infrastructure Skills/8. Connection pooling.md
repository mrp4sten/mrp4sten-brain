# PgBouncer

PgBouncer is a lightweight connection pooler for PostgreSQL, designed to reduce the overhead associated with establishing new database connections. It sits between the client and the PostgreSQL server, maintaining a pool of active connections that clients can reuse, thus improving performance and resource utilization. PgBouncer supports multiple pooling modes, including session pooling, transaction pooling, and statement pooling, catering to different use cases and workloads. It is highly configurable, allowing for fine-tuning of connection limits, authentication methods, and other parameters to optimize database access and performance.

# Connection Pooling: Alternatives to PgBouncer

## Pgpool-II

Pgpool-II is another widely-used connection pooler for PostgreSQL. It provides several advanced features, such as load balancing, replication, and limiting connections.

- **Load Balancing** - Pgpool-II can distribute read queries among multiple PostgreSQL servers to balance the read load, helping to improve overall performance.
- **Replication** - In addition to connection pooling, Pgpool-II can act as a replication tool for creating real-time data backups.
- **Limiting Connections** - You can set connection limits for clients to control the maximum number of allowed connections for specific users or databases.

## HAProxy

HAProxy is a high-performance and highly-available load balancer for TCP and HTTP-based applications, including PostgreSQL. It is particularly well-suited for distributing connections across multiple PostgreSQL servers for high availability and load balancing.

- **Connection Distribution** - HAProxy uses load balancing algorithms to ensure connections are evenly distributed across the available servers, which can help prevent connection overloading.
- **Health Checking** - HAProxy can perform periodic health checks on your PostgreSQL servers, which can help to ensure that client connections are redirected to healthy servers.
- **SSL Support** - HAProxy provides SSL/TLS support, enabling secure connections between clients and PostgreSQL servers.

## Odyssey

Odyssey is an open-source, multithreaded connection pooler for PostgreSQL developed by Yandex. It is designed for high-performance and large-scale deployments and supports features like transparent SSL, load balancing, and advanced routing.

- **High Performance** - Odyssey uses a multithreaded architecture to process its connections, which can help significantly increase its performance compared to single-threaded connection poolers.
- **Advanced Routing** - Odyssey allows you to configure routing rules and load balancing based on client, server, user, and even specific SQL queries.
- **Transparent SSL** - Odyssey supports transparent SSL connections between clients and PostgreSQL servers, ensuring secure communication.
