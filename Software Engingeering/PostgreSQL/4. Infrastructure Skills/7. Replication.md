# Logical Replication

Logical replication in PostgreSQL allows the selective replication of data between databases, providing flexibility in synchronizing data across different systems. Unlike physical replication, which copies entire databases or clusters, logical replication operates at a finer granularity, allowing the replication of individual tables or specific subsets of data. This is achieved through the use of replication slots and publications/subscriptions. A publication defines a set of changes (INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE) to be replicated, and a subscription subscribes to these changes from a publisher database to a subscriber database. Logical replication supports diverse use cases such as real-time data warehousing, database migration, and multi-master replication, where different nodes can handle both reads and writes. Configuration involves creating publications on the source database and corresponding subscriptions on the target database, ensuring continuous, asynchronous data flow with minimal impact on performance.

# Streaming Replication in PostgreSQL

Streaming Replication is a powerful feature in PostgreSQL that allows efficient real-time replication of data across multiple servers. It is a type of asynchronous replication, meaning that the replication process occurs continuously in the background without waiting for transactions to be committed. The primary purpose of streaming replication is to ensure high availability and fault tolerance, as well as to facilitate load balancing for read-heavy workloads. In the context of PostgreSQL, streaming replication involves a _primary_ server and one or more _standby_ servers. The primary server processes write operations and then streams the changes (or write-ahead logs, also known as WAL) to the standby servers, which apply the changes to their local copies of the database. The replication is unidirectional â€“ data flows only from the primary server to the standby servers.
