## 3rd Party

**Barman (Backup and Recovery Manager)**

Barman (Backup and Recovery Manager) is a robust tool designed for managing PostgreSQL backups and disaster recovery. It supports various backup types, including full and incremental backups, and provides features for remote backups, backup retention policies, and compression to optimize storage. Barman also offers point-in-time recovery (PITR) capabilities and integrates with PostgreSQL’s WAL archiving to ensure data integrity. With its extensive monitoring and reporting capabilities, Barman helps database administrators automate and streamline backup processes, ensuring reliable and efficient recovery options in case of data loss or corruption.

**WAL-G - An Advanced Backup Recovery Tool for PostgreSQL**

WAL-G is an open-source archival and restoration tool for PostgreSQL and MySQL/MariaDB, designed for managing Write-Ahead Logs (WAL) and performing continuous archiving. It extends the capabilities of the traditional pg_basebackup by supporting features like delta backups, compression, and encryption. WAL-G is optimized for cloud storage, integrating seamlessly with services like Amazon S3, Google Cloud Storage, and Azure Blob Storage. It ensures efficient backup storage by deduplicating data and providing incremental backup capabilities. Additionally, WAL-G supports point-in-time recovery, allowing databases to be restored to any specific time, enhancing disaster recovery processes.

**pgBackRest: A Comprehensive Backup and Recovery Solution**

pgBackRest is a robust backup and restore solution for PostgreSQL, designed for high performance and reliability. It supports full, differential, and incremental backups, and provides features like parallel processing, backup validation, and compression to optimize storage and speed. pgBackRest also includes support for point-in-time recovery (PITR), encryption, and remote operations. Its configuration flexibility and extensive documentation make it suitable for various PostgreSQL deployment scenarios, ensuring efficient data protection and disaster recovery.

**Pg_probackup**

pg_probackup is a backup and recovery manager for PostgreSQL, designed to handle periodic backups of PostgreSQL clusters. It supports incremental backups, merge strategies to avoid frequent full backups, validation, and parallelization for efficiency. It also offers features like backup from standby servers, remote operations, and compression. With support for PostgreSQL versions 11 through 16, it enables comprehensive management of backups and WAL archives, ensuring data integrity and efficient recovery processes.
## Builtin Tools

**pg_dump: A PostgreSQL Backup Tool**

pg_dump is a utility for backing up a PostgreSQL database by exporting its data and schema. Unlike pg_basebackup, which takes a physical backup of the entire cluster, pg_dump produces a logical backup of a single database. It can output data in various formats, including plain SQL, custom, directory, and tar, allowing for flexible restore options. pg_dump can be used to selectively backup specific tables, schemas, or data, making it suitable for tasks like migrating databases or creating development copies. The utility ensures the backup is consistent by using the database’s built-in mechanisms to capture a snapshot of the data at the time of the dump.

**pg_dumpall: Backing Up Entire PostgreSQL Clusters**

pg_dumpall is a utility for backing up all databases in a PostgreSQL cluster, including cluster-wide data such as roles and tablespaces. It creates a plain text SQL script file that contains the commands to recreate the cluster’s databases and their contents, as well as the global objects. This utility is useful for comprehensive backups where both database data and cluster-wide settings need to be preserved. Unlike pg_dump, which targets individual databases, pg_dumpall ensures that the entire PostgreSQL cluster can be restored from the backup, making it essential for complete disaster recovery scenarios.

**pg_restore**

pg_restore is a utility for restoring PostgreSQL database backups created by pg_dump in non-plain-text formats (custom, directory, or tar). It allows for selective restoration of database objects such as tables, schemas, or indexes, providing flexibility to restore specific parts of the database. pg_restore can also be used to reorder data load operations, create indexes and constraints after data load, and parallelize the restore process to speed up recovery. This utility ensures efficient and customizable restoration from logical backups.

**Backup Recovery Tools: pg_basebackup**

pg_basebackup is a utility for creating a physical backup of a PostgreSQL database cluster. It generates a consistent backup of the entire database cluster by copying data files while ensuring write operations do not interfere. Typically used for setting up streaming replication or disaster recovery, pg_basebackup can be run in parallel mode to speed up the process and can output backups in tar format or as a plain directory. It ensures minimal disruption to database operations during the backup process.

# Backup Validation Procedures

It’s not enough to just take backups; you must also ensure that your backups are valid and restorable. A corrupt or incomplete backup can lead to data loss or downtime during a crisis. Therefore, it’s essential to follow best practices and validate your PostgreSQL backups periodically.

## Key Validation Procedures

Here are the critical backup validation procedures you should follow:

- **Restore Test**: Regularly perform a restore test using your backups to ensure that the backup files can be used for a successful restoration of your PostgreSQL database. This process can be automated using scripts and scheduled tasks.
    
- **Checksum Verification**: Use checksums during the backup process to validate the backed-up data. Checksums can help detect errors caused by corruption or data tampering. PostgreSQL provides built-in checksum support, which can be enabled at the database level.
    
- **File-Level Validation**: Compare the files in your backup with the source files in your PostgreSQL database. This will ensure that your backup contains all the necessary files and that their content matches the original data.
    
- **Backup Logs Monitoring**: Monitor and analyze the logs generated during your PostgreSQL backup process. Pay close attention to any warnings, errors, or unusual messages. Investigate and resolve any issues to maintain the integrity of your backups.
    
- **Automated Testing**: Set up automated tests to simulate a disaster recovery scenario and see if your backup can restore the database fully. This will not only validate your backups but also test the overall reliability of your recovery plan.
    

## Post-validation Actions

After validating your backups, it’s essential to document the results and address any issues encountered during the validation process. This may involve refining your backup and recovery strategies, fixing any errors or updating your scripts and tools.
