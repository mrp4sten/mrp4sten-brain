# Simple Stateful Setup

Here are the key components and steps involved in setting up a simple stateful `PostgreSQL` deployment on `Kubernetes`:

- **Create a Storage Class**: Define a `StorageClass` resource in `Kubernetes`, specifying the type of storage to be used and the access mode (read-write, read-only, etc.).
- **Create a Persistent Volume Claim**: Define a `PersistentVolumeClaim` (PVC) to request a specific amount of storage from the storage class for your `PostgreSQL` database.
- **Create a ConfigMap**: Define a `ConfigMap` to store your database configuration settings (e.g., usernames, passwords, etc.), separate from your application code.
- **Create a Secret**: Store sensitive data (e.g., database passwords) securely in a `Secret` object. The `Secret` will be mounted as a volume in the pod and the environment variables will be set.
- **Create a StatefulSet**: Define a `StatefulSet` that manages the deployment of your `PostgreSQL` pods. Specify the container image, port, volumes (PVC and ConfigMap), and a startup script. It ensures the unique identifier for each pod and guarantees the order of pod creation/deletion.

# Helm - Package Manager for Kubernetes

Helm is a popular package manager for Kubernetes that allows you to easily deploy, manage, and upgrade applications on your Kubernetes cluster. In the Kubernetes world, Helm plays a similar role as “apt” or “yum” in the Linux ecosystem.

Helm streamlines the installation process by providing ready-to-use packages called “charts”. A Helm chart is a collection of YAML files, templates, and manifests, that describe an application’s required resources and configurations.

# Operators in Kubernetes Deployment

Operators in Kubernetes are software extensions that use custom resources to manage applications and their components. They encapsulate operational knowledge and automate complex tasks such as deployments, backups, and scaling. Using Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs) and custom controllers, Operators continuously monitor the state of the application and reconcile it with the desired state, ensuring the system is self-healing and resilient. Popular frameworks for building Operators include the Operator SDK, Kubebuilder, and Metacontroller, which simplify the process and enhance Kubernetes’ capability to manage stateful and complex applications efficiently.
