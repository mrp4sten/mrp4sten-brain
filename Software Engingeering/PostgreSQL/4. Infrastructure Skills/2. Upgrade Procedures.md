# Using pg_upgrade

`pg_upgrade` is a PostgreSQL utility that facilitates the in-place upgrade of a PostgreSQL database cluster to a new major version. It allows users to upgrade their database without needing to dump and restore the database, significantly reducing downtime. Here are the key steps involved in using `pg_upgrade`:

1. **Preparation**: Before starting the upgrade, ensure both the old and new versions of PostgreSQL are installed. Backup the existing database cluster and ensure no connections are active.
2. **Initialize the New Cluster**: Initialize a new PostgreSQL cluster with the target version using `initdb`.
3. **Run `pg_upgrade`**: Execute the `pg_upgrade` command, specifying the data directories of the old and new clusters, and the paths to the old and new `pg_ctl` binaries.
4. **Analyze and Optimize**: After the upgrade, run the `analyze_new_cluster.sh` script generated by `pg_upgrade` to update optimizer statistics. This step is crucial for performance.
5. **Finalize**: If everything works correctly, you can start the new cluster and remove the old cluster to free up space.

# Using Logical Replication

Logical replication is an asynchronous feature that allows data modification to be transferred from a source (publisher) to a target system (subscriber) across different PostgreSQL database versions. It provides more granular control over the data copied and is useful during an upgrade.

**Advantages of Logical Replication**

- It allows you to replicate only specific tables, rather than the entire database.
- You can create replicas with different database schemas by using a transformation layer between publisher and subscriber.
- It allows you to perform a live upgrade, avoiding the downtime of your database.
