# Schema Design Patterns in PostgreSQL

Schema design patterns in PostgreSQL ensure efficient and scalable databases by using normalization to reduce redundancy and maintain data integrity, while denormalization improves read performance for read-heavy applications. Employing star and snowflake schemas optimizes query performance in data warehousing, with the former having a central fact table and the latter normalizing dimension tables. Partitioning tables based on specific criteria enhances query performance and maintenance, while strategic use of indexes speeds up data retrieval. Foreign keys and constraints maintain data integrity, and materialized views precompute complex queries for faster access to summary data, collectively ensuring an optimized and robust database design.
