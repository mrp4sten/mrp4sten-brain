Set operations are useful when you need to perform actions on whole sets of data, such as merging or comparing them. Set operations include UNION, INTERSECT, and EXCEPT, and they can be vital tools in querying complex datasets.

### **UNION and UNION ALL**

- **UNION**: Combines the results of two queries and removes duplicate rows. The output includes all unique rows from both result sets.
    - **Syntax**: `SELECT column(s) FROM table1 UNION SELECT column(s) FROM table2;`
- **UNION ALL**: Combines the results of two queries but **does not remove duplicates**. It returns all rows from both result sets, including any duplicates.
    - **Syntax**: `SELECT column(s) FROM table1 UNION ALL SELECT column(s) FROM table2;`

###  **INTERSECT**

- **INTERSECT**: Returns only the rows that appear in **both result sets**. It’s like the logical intersection between two sets, showing only the common data.
- **Syntax**: `SELECT column(s) FROM table1 INTERSECT SELECT column(s) FROM table2;`
- This operation removes duplicates, keeping only distinct rows.

###  **INTERSECT ALL**

- **INTERSECT ALL**: Similar to `INTERSECT`, but **retains duplicates**. If a row appears `n` times in both queries, it will appear `n` times in the result set.
- **Syntax**: `SELECT column(s) FROM table1 INTERSECT ALL SELECT column(s) FROM table2;`

###  **EXCEPT**

- **EXCEPT**: Returns only the rows from the first query that **do not appear** in the second query. It effectively performs a “set difference” operation.
- **Syntax**: `SELECT column(s) FROM table1 EXCEPT SELECT column(s) FROM table2;`
- This operation removes duplicates, returning only unique rows.

###  **EXCEPT ALL**

- **EXCEPT ALL**: Similar to `EXCEPT`, but **retains duplicates**. If a row appears multiple times in the first result set and doesn’t appear in the second, all instances of that row will be included in the output.
- **Syntax**: `SELECT column(s) FROM table1 EXCEPT ALL SELECT column(s) FROM table2;`

#### Example
```sql
-- Find all unique names from both tables:
SELECT name FROM employees
UNION
SELECT name FROM contractors;

-- Find common names between tables:
SELECT name FROM employees
INTERSECT
SELECT name FROM contractors;

-- Find names only in employees, not in contractors:
SELECT name FROM employees
EXCEPT
SELECT name FROM contractors;
