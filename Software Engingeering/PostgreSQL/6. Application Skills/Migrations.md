# Practical Patterns for Migrations

Practical patterns for PostgreSQL migrations include using version control tools like Liquibase or Flyway to manage schema changes, applying incremental updates to minimize risk, maintaining backward compatibility during transitions, and employing zero-downtime techniques like rolling updates. Data migration scripts should be thoroughly tested in staging environments to ensure accuracy. Employing transactional DDL statements helps ensure atomic changes, while monitoring and having rollback plans in place can quickly address any issues. These strategies ensure smooth, reliable migrations with minimal application disruption.

Migrations are crucial in the lifecycle of database applications. As the application evolves, changes to the database schema and sometimes data itself become necessary.
