# Top Command in PostgreSQL

`top` is a command-line utility that comes pre-installed on most Unix-based operating systems such as Linux, macOS, and BSD. It provides a dynamic, real-time view of the processes running on a system, displaying valuable information like process ID, user, CPU usage, memory usage, and more.

# Sysstat

Sysstat is a collection of performance monitoring tools for Linux. It collects various system statistics, such as CPU usage, memory usage, disk activity, network traffic, and more. System administrators can use these tools to monitor the performance of their servers and identify potential bottlenecks and areas for improvement.

# iotop

`iotop` is an essential command-line utility that provides real-time insights into the input/output (I/O) activities of processes running on your system. This tool is particularly useful when monitoring and managing your PostgreSQL databaseâ€™s performance, as it helps system administrators or database developers to identify processes with high I/O, leading to potential bottlenecks or server optimization opportunities.
