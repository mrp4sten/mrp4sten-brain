# pgCluu

PgCluu is a powerful and easy-to-use PostgreSQL performance monitoring and tuning tool. This open-source program collects statistics and provides various metrics in order to analyze PostgreSQL databases, helping you discover performance bottlenecks and optimize your cluster’s performance. Apart from PostgreSQL-specific settings, you can also tweak other options, such as the RRDtool’s data file format (JPG or SVG), time range for graphs, and more.
# PgBadger

PgBadger is a fast, efficient PostgreSQL log analyzer and report generator. It parses PostgreSQL log files to generate detailed reports on database performance, query statistics, connection information, and more. PgBadger supports various log formats and provides insights into slow queries, index usage, and overall database activity. Its reports, typically in HTML format, include visual charts and graphs for easy interpretation. PgBadger is valuable for database administrators looking to optimize performance and troubleshoot issues based on log data.

# Grep Command in Log Analysis

Grep is a powerful command-line tool used for searching plain-text data sets against specific patterns. It was originally developed for the Unix operating system and has since become available on almost every platform. When analyzing PostgreSQL logs, you may find the `grep` command an incredibly useful resource for quickly finding specific entries or messages.

# Sed: The Stream Editor

Sed is a powerful command-line utility for text processing and manipulation in Unix-based systems, including Linux operating systems. It operates on a text stream – reading from a file, standard input, or a pipe from another command – and applies a series of editing instructions known as “scripts” to transform the input text into a desired output format.
