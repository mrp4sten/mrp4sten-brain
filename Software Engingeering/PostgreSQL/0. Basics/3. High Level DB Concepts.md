High-level database concepts encompass fundamental principles that underpin the design, implementation, and management of database systems.

## ACID

ACID are the four properties of relational database systems that help in making sure that we are able to perform the transactions in a reliable manner. It’s an acronym which refers to the presence of four properties: atomicity, consistency, isolation and durability

## Multi-Version Concurrency Control (MVCC)

Multi-Version Concurrency Control (MVCC) is a technique used by PostgreSQL to allow multiple transactions to access the same data concurrently without conflicts or delays. It ensures that each transaction has a consistent snapshot of the database and can operate on its own version of the data.

## Write Ahead Log (WAL)

The Write Ahead Log, also known as the WAL, is a crucial part of PostgreSQL’s data consistency strategy. The WAL records all changes made to the database in a sequential log before they are written to the actual data files. In case of a crash, PostgreSQL can use the WAL to bring the database back to a consistent state without losing any crucial data. This provides durability and crash recovery capabilities for your database.


## Query Processing in PostgreSQL

Query processing is an important aspect of a database system, as it is responsible for managing data retrieval and modification using Structured Query Language (SQL) queries. Efficient query processing is crucial for ensuring optimal database performance.

PostgreSQL assigns a dedicated backend process to handle queries from each client connection, enhancing its robustness and stability.

This subsystem is methodically organized into five key areas:

- **Parser**: The initial phase where queries are checked for syntactic validity.
- **Analyzer**: This stage examines the query to ensure all referenced objects exist and are accessible, and it also infers the data types of all expressions.
- **Rewriter**: At this point, any views referred to in the query are expanded and any rule-based substitutions are applied.
- **Planner**: The planner evaluates various strategies for executing the query based on the available indexes and the estimated cost of different approaches.
- **Executor**: Finally, the executor carries out the chosen plan, actually retrieving or modifying data.
