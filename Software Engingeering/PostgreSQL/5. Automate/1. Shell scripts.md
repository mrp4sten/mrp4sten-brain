Shell scripts are a powerful tool used to automate repetitive tasks and perform complex operations. They are essentially text files containing a sequence of commands to be executed by the shell (such as Bash or Zsh). By leveraging shell scripts with tools such as `cron`, you can efficiently automate tasks related to PostgreSQL and streamline your database administration processes.
