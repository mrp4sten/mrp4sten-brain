Row Level Security (RLS) is a feature introduced in PostgreSQL 9.5 that allows you to control access to rows in a table based on a user or roleâ€™s permissions. This level of granularity in data access provides an extra layer of security for protecting sensitive information from unauthorized access.

#### **Key Concepts:**

1. **Policy**: Defines which rows are visible or accessible to a particular user.
2. **Enable RLS**: RLS must be explicitly enabled on a table.
3. **Security-Barrier Views**: You can use views to implement RLS more easily by combining RLS policies with views that filter data.

#### **How RLS Works:**

- RLS works by **defining policies** that filter the data based on user-specific conditions.
- Policies are applied automatically whenever a `SELECT`, `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, or `DELETE` operation is performed on a table.

#### Example
```sql
-- Enable RLS
ALTER TABLE my_table ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- Create a policy that only allows users to see their own rows
CREATE POLICY user_policy
ON my_table
FOR SELECT
USING (user_id = current_user_id());

-- Enable the policy
ALTER TABLE my_table ENABLE POLICY user_policy;
```
