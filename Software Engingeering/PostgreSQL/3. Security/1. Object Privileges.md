Object privileges in PostgreSQL are the permissions given to different user roles to access or modify database objects like tables, views, sequences, and functions. Ensuring proper object privileges is crucial for maintaining a secure and well-functioning database.

- Roles are basically users and groups. It acts like both; you can log in as a role, and a role can belong to another role. Each role has an attribute like `LOGIN` and `INHERIT` that indicate whether you can log in as that role and whether the role inherits privileges from the roles it belongs to. You can add a role to a member of another role by using `GRANT ROLE ...` command.

- Objects in PostgreSQL are databases, tables, etc.. There is a tree structure in PostgreSQL objects. A PostgreSQL instance can have multiple databases. A database can have multiple schemas. A schema can have multiple tables.

- Privileges are permissions defined over PostgreSQL objects. For example, there is a `SELECT` privilege on tables, which is a permission to run `SELECT` queries on them. Every kind of object has a different set of privileges.
