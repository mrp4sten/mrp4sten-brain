### Key Concepts

1. **Networking**: This involves establishing a connection between different systems (clients and servers) and exchanging data. In Java, you typically use **TCP/IP (Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol)** or **UDP (User Datagram Protocol)** for data transmission.
    
2. **Sockets**: A socket represents one endpoint in a two-way communication link between two programs running on the network. Java supports both **TCP sockets** and **UDP sockets**.
    
    - **TCP Sockets** (`Socket` and `ServerSocket` classes): TCP is connection-oriented, meaning it ensures reliable and ordered data delivery. It's commonly used for applications that require reliable communication, such as web servers, email, and file transfers.
    - **UDP Sockets** (`DatagramSocket` and `DatagramPacket` classes): UDP is connectionless, so it doesn’t guarantee reliability or order. It’s faster than TCP and used for applications where speed is critical and occasional data loss is tolerable, like video streaming or online gaming.

### Basic Java Networking Classes

1. **Socket (Client-Side TCP Connection)**: This class creates a client-side TCP socket that connects to a specified server.
    
    - Example: `Socket socket = new Socket("hostname", port);`
2. **ServerSocket (Server-Side TCP Connection)**: This class listens for incoming TCP requests on a specified port and establishes connections with clients.
    
    - Example: `ServerSocket serverSocket = new ServerSocket(port);`
3. **DatagramSocket (UDP)**: This class creates a UDP socket for sending and receiving data packets.
    
    - Example: `DatagramSocket socket = new DatagramSocket();`
4. **InetAddress**: This class represents an IP address and provides methods to find the IP address of a host.
    
    - Example: `InetAddress address = InetAddress.getByName("hostname");`

### Basic Workflow for TCP Sockets

1. **Server Setup**:
    
    - Create a `ServerSocket` object and bind it to a port.
    - Wait for incoming client connections using `accept()`.
    - Communicate with the client using input/output streams.
2. **Client Setup**:
    
    - Create a `Socket` object and connect it to the server’s IP address and port.
    - Communicate with the server using input/output streams.

### Example: Basic TCP Communication

**Server Code**
```java
import java.net.*;
import java.io.*;

public class SimpleServer {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try (ServerSocket serverSocket = new ServerSocket(5000)) {
            System.out.println("Server is listening on port 5000");
            Socket socket = serverSocket.accept();
            InputStream input = socket.getInputStream();
            BufferedReader reader = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(input));
            String message = reader.readLine();
            System.out.println("Received: " + message);
        } catch (IOException ex) {
            ex.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
}
```

**Client code**
```java
import java.net.*;
import java.io.*;

public class SimpleClient {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try (Socket socket = new Socket("localhost", 5000)) {
            OutputStream output = socket.getOutputStream();
            PrintWriter writer = new PrintWriter(output, true);
            writer.println("Hello, Server!");
        } catch (IOException ex) {
            ex.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
}
```

### Key Points

- **TCP Sockets** are used for reliable communication with guaranteed data delivery.
- **UDP Sockets** are used for fast, connectionless communication with no guarantee of delivery.
- **Networking** in Java is efficient and widely used in real-world applications such as messaging systems, online games, and distributed applications.
