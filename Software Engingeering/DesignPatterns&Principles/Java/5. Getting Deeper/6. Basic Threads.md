## Summary
### Whats a thread on java?
A thread is a lightweight sub-process, a unit of execution within a program.
Java allows concurrent execution, meaning multiple threads can run simultaneously to improve performance, especially on multi-core processors.
### Life-cycle
- **New**: Thread is created but not started.
- **Runnable**: Thread is ready to run but waiting for CPU time.
- **Running**: Thread is executing its task.
- **Blocked/Waiting**: Thread is paused, waiting for a resource or signal.
- **Terminated**: Thread finishes execution or is stopped.
### Creating thread 
```java
// Extending <Thread> class
class MyThread extends Thread {
    public void run() {
        System.out.println("Thread is running");
    }
}
public class Test {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        MyThread t = new MyThread();
        t.start();  // Start the thread
    }
}

// Implementing the <Runnable> interface
class MyRunnable implements Runnable {
    public void run() {
        System.out.println("Runnable thread is running");
    }
}
public class Test {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Thread t = new Thread(new MyRunnable());
        t.start();  // Start the thread
    }
}
```
### Thread Methods
- **`start()`**: Starts the thread.
- **`run()`**: Contains the logic to execute (overridden in subclasses).
- **`sleep(milliseconds)`**: Pauses thread temporarily.
- **`join()`**: Waits for another thread to complete.
- **`yield()`**: Suggests the current thread gives way to others.
- **`interrupt()`**: Interrupts the thread's execution.
### Synchronization
- **Problem**: When multiple threads access shared resources, it can lead to **race conditions**.
- **Solution**: Java provides **synchronization** to ensure only one thread accesses a resource at a time.
```java
class Counter {
    private int count = 0;
    public synchronized void increment() {
        count++;
    }
    public int getCount() {
        return count;
    }
}
```
### Inter-thread communication
Java provides methods like **`wait()`**, **`notify()`**, and **`notifyAll()`** for communication between threads.

- **`wait()`**: Pauses the thread until notified.
- **`notify()`**: Wakes up one waiting thread.
- **`notifyAll()`**: Wakes up all waiting threads.
### Thread priorities 
Each thread has a **priority** (default is 5). Higher priority threads get more CPU time but don't guarantee execution order.

- `MIN_PRIORITY` = 1
- `NORM_PRIORITY` = 5
- `MAX_PRIORITY` = 10
### Thread Pools and Executors (Java 5+)
For managing multiple threads efficiently, Java provides **Executor Framework**:
```java
ExecutorService executor = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(2);
executor.submit(new MyRunnable());
executor.shutdown();
```
### Advantages 
- **Concurrency**: Multiple tasks can run in parallel.
- **Efficient resource use**: Better use of CPU.
- **Responsiveness**: User interfaces remain responsive (e.g., in GUI apps).
