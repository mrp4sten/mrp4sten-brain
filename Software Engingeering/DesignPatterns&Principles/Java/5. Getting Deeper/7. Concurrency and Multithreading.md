## Introduction
Concurrency is a term that covers multi threading, concurrency and parallelism on java platform. That includes the Java concurrency tools. problems and solutions. 
### What is multi threading?
Multi threading means that you have multiple *threads* of execution inside the same application. A thread is like a separate CPU existing your application. Thus, a multi threaded application is like an application that has multiple CPU's executing different parts of the code at the same time.

A thread is not equal to CPU. Usually a single CPU will share its execution time among multiple threads, switching between executing each of the threads for a given amount of time.

### Why multi threading?
- **Better utilization of a single CPU**: One of the most common reasons is to be able to better utilize the resources in the computer. For instance, if one thread is waiting for the response to a request sent over the network, then another thread could use the CPU in the meantime to do something else. Additionally, if the computer has multiple CPUs, or if the CPU has multiple execution cores, then multithreading can also help your application utilize these extra CPU cores.
- **Better utilization of multiple CPU's or CPU cores**: If a computer contains multiple CPUs or the CPU contains multiple execution cores, then you need to use multiple threads for your application to be able to utilize all of the CPUs or CPU cores. A single thread can at most utilize a single CPU, and as I mentioned above, sometimes not even completely utilize a single CPU. 
- **Better user experience with regards to responsiveness**: Provide a better user experience. For instance, if you click on a button in a GUI and this results in a request being sent over the network, then it matters which thread performs this request. If you use the same thread that is also updating the GUI, then the user might experience the GUI "hanging" while the GUI thread is waiting for the response for the request. Instead, such a request could be performed by a backgroun thread so the GUI thread is free to respond to other user requests in the meantime.
- **Better user experience with regards to fairness**: Share resources of a computer more fairly among users. As example imagine a server that receives requests from clients, and only has one thread to execute these requests. If a client sends a requests that takes a long time to process, then all other client's requests would have to wait until that one request has finished. By having each client's request executed by its own thread then no single task can monopolize the CPU completely.
### Multi threading and Multi tasking

|**Aspect**|**Multithreading**|**Multitasking**|
|---|---|---|
|**Scope**|Within a single process|Across multiple processes|
|**Management**|By the process and the OS|Managed by the OS|
|**Communication**|Faster (shared memory)|Slower (IPC)|
|**Resources**|Lower memory consumption|Higher resource consumption|
|**Complexity**|Risk of synchronization issues|Fewer internal conflicts|
|**Example**|Server handling multiple clients|Browsing while listening to music|
## Models
### Shared and Separate state
_Shared state_ means that the different threads in the system will share some state among them.

_Separate state_ means that the different threads in the system do not share any state among them.In case the different threads need to communicate, they do so either by exchanging immutable objects among them, or by sending copies of objects (or data) among them.

### Parallel workers
In the parallel workers concurrency model a delegator distributes the incoming jobs to different workers. Each worker completes the full job. The workers work in parallel, running in different threads, and possibly on different CPUs.

### Assembly line
The workers are organized like workers at an assembly line in a factory. Each worker only performs a part of the full job. When that part is finished the worker forwards the job to the next worker.
