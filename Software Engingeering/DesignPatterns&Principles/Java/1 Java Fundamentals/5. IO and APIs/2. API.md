### 1. **Old API: `HttpURLConnection` (java.net.HttpURLConnection)**

- **Introduced**: In early Java versions (before Java 9).
    
- **Usage**:
    
    - Provides basic functionality for sending HTTP requests and receiving responses (GET, POST, etc.).
    - Requires **manual handling** of input/output streams for reading responses.
    - **Blocking I/O**: Each request blocks the current thread until the response is received.
- Cons:
	    - - Verbose and low-level.
		- No built-in support for **asynchronous** operations.
		- Harder to work with when dealing with modern HTTP features like timeouts, redirects, or cookies.
Example
```java
URL url = new URL("https://example.com");
HttpURLConnection conn = (HttpURLConnection) url.openConnection();
conn.setRequestMethod("GET");
InputStream in = conn.getInputStream();
// Process response...
in.close();
```

### 2. **New API: `HttpClient` (java.net.http.HttpClient)**

- **Introduced**: Java 11.
    
- **Features**:
    
    - **Simpler syntax** for making HTTP requests.
    - Supports **asynchronous** and **synchronous** requests.
    - Modern HTTP/2 support (faster and more efficient).
    - Built-in support for **timeouts**, **redirects**, and **authentication**.
- Pros
	- Easier to use with **cleaner code**.
	- **Non-blocking I/O** support with async methods.
	- Supports **HTTP/2** by default.
Example
```java
HttpClient client = HttpClient.newHttpClient();
HttpRequest request = HttpRequest.newBuilder()
    .uri(URI.create("https://example.com"))
    .GET()
    .build();

HttpResponse<String> response = client.send(request, HttpResponse.BodyHandlers.ofString());
System.out.println(response.body());

// Async example
client.sendAsync(request, HttpResponse.BodyHandlers.ofString())
      .thenAccept(response -> System.out.println(response.body()));
```
