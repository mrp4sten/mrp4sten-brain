[[Domain-Driven design]]

**Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**

DDD and OOP are often used together. DDD’s emphasis on modeling real-world concepts aligns well with OOP’s approach of encapsulating data and behavior into objects. Entities, value objects, and aggregates in DDD can be seen as instances of classes in OOP.

**Model-Driven Engineering (MDE)**

While DDD focuses on creating a domain model that reflects the business domain, MDE is about creating abstract models of the software system and automatically generating code from these models. DDD can benefit from MDE by using it to facilitate the creation of the domain model and the subsequent code generation.

**Command Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS)**

CQRS is a pattern that separates read operations (queries) from write operations (commands) in a system. While not a requirement for DDD, it can complement DDD by providing a clear boundary and separation of concerns between different parts of the system.

**Event Sourcing**

This is a pattern where state changes in the system are stored as a sequence of events. When combined with DDD, it can provide a reliable and traceable way of managing state changes in the system.
