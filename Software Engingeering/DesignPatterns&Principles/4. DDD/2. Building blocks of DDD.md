[[Domain-Driven design]]

**Bounded Contexts**

In complex systems, the business domain may encompass various aspects, each with its own specific rules and requirements. Bounded contexts define logical boundaries within the system, where a particular domain model applies. Each bounded context encapsulates its own ubiquitous language, isolated from others, which grants independence and flexibility to different parts of the system. This separation allows teams to focus on their specific domains without undue interference or complexity from unrelated areas.

**Entities**

In the real world, certain objects possess a unique identity that endures over time, despite undergoing various states or changes. DDD introduces the concept of entities, which represent such objects within the software domain. Unlike traditional objects defined solely by their attributes, entities are primarily defined by their distinct identity. For example, in a customer management system, a customer is an entity with a persistent identity, regardless of changes in their name, address, or other attributes.

**Value Objects**

On the other hand, some objects within the domain are characterized primarily by their attributes rather than a unique identity. DDD identifies these as value objects. Value objects are often immutable, meaning their state cannot be altered once created. They can be freely replaced with another instance with the same attributes without changing the overall state of the system. Examples of value objects include date ranges, addresses, or monetary amounts.

**Aggregates**

In complex domains, entities and value objects often have meaningful relationships and dependencies. Aggregates serve as clusters that group together entities and value objects, treating them as a single unit. An aggregate has a root entity, known as an aggregate root, through which all interactions with the aggregate occur. Aggregates maintain the consistency and integrity of related objects, ensuring that changes to the cluster remain coherent and adhere to the domainâ€™s rules and invariants.

**Domain Events**

Within the business domain, certain events hold great significance and may trigger actions or reactions in various parts of the system. Domain events capture these important moments, representing something that has occurred within the domain in the past. By broadcasting these events, the software can react and respond accordingly, maintaining the integrity and coherence of the system as the business domain evolves.
