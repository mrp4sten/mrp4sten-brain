[[Architectural Patterns]]

Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA) is an architectural pattern where software components, known as services, are designed to be reusable, loosely coupled, and interact over a network. Each service is a self-contained unit that performs a specific business function and communicates with other services through standardized protocols and data formats, such as HTTP and XML. SOA enables organizations to build scalable, flexible, and interoperable systems by allowing services to be developed, deployed, and maintained independently. This approach promotes modularity, easier integration of disparate systems, and agility in adapting to changing business requirements.

## How does service-oriented architecture work?

In service-oriented architecture (SOA), services function independently and provide functionality or data exchanges to their consumers. The consumer requests information and sends input data to the service. The service processes the data, performs the task, and sends back a response. For example, if an application uses an authorization service, it gives the service the username and password. The service verifies the username and password and returns an appropriate response.
### Communication protocols

Services communicate using established rules that determine data transmission over a network. These rules are called communication protocols. Some standard protocols to implement SOA include the following:

• Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP)  
• RESTful HTTP  
• Apache Thrift  
• Apache ActiveMQ  
• Java Message Service (JMS)
