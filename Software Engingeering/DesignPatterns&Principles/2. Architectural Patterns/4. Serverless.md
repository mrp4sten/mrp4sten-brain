[[Architectural Patterns]]

Serverless computing is a cloud computing model where developers build and run applications without managing server infrastructure. In this model, cloud providers handle the server management, scaling, and maintenance tasks. Developers deploy code in the form of functions, which are executed in response to events or triggers, and are billed based on the actual usage rather than reserved capacity. This approach simplifies development by abstracting infrastructure concerns, enabling automatic scaling, and reducing operational overhead. Common serverless platforms include AWS Lambda, Google Cloud Functions, and Azure Functions, which support a range of event-driven applications and microservices.

Serverless is more than function as a service (FaaS)—the cloud computing service that enables developers to run code or containers in response to specific events or requests without specifying or managing the infrastructure required to run the code.

FaaS is the compute model central to serverless, and the two terms are often used interchangeably. Compared to FaaS, serverless is an entire stack of services that can respond to specific events or requests and scale to zero when no longer in use—and for which provisioning, management and billing are handled by the cloud provider and invisible to developers.

## Use cases

- **Microservices:** The most common use case of serverless today is supporting microservices architectures. While microservices can also be build and operated through either PaaS or containers, serverless gained significant momentum given it attributes around small bits of code inherent and automatic scaling, rapid provisioning and pricing model that never charges for idle capacity.
- **API Backends:** Any action or function in a serverless platform can be turned into an HTTP endpoint ready to be consumed by web clients. When enabled for the web these actions are called web actions. 
- **Open liberty InstantOn (CRIU):** Take a novel approach to support raid startup for serverless applications. Whit InstantOn you can take a checkpoint of your running Java application process during application build and then restore that checkpoint in production. The restore is fast, which makes it deal for serverless.
- **Data Processing:**  Serverless is well suited to working with structured text, audio, image and video data around tasks such as data enrichment, transformation, validation, and cleansing. Developers can also use it for PDF processing, audo normalization, image processing, optical character recognition (OCR) and video transcoding.
