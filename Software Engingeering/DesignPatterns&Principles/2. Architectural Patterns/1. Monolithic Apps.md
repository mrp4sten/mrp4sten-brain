[[Architectural Patterns]]

Monolithic applications are designed as a single, cohesive unit where all components—such as user interface, business logic, and data access—are tightly integrated and run as a single service. This architecture simplifies development and deployment since the entire application is managed and deployed together. However, it can lead to challenges with scalability, maintainability, and agility as the application grows. Changes to one part of the application may require redeploying the entire system, and scaling might necessitate duplicating the entire application rather than scaling individual components. Monolithic architectures can be suitable for smaller applications or projects with less complex requirements, but many organizations transition to microservices or modular architectures to address these limitations as they scale.
