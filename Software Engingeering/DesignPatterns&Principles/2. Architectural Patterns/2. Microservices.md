[[Architectural Patterns]]

Microservices is an architectural style that structures an application as a collection of loosely coupled, independently deployable services. Each microservice focuses on a specific business capability and communicates with others via lightweight protocols, typically HTTP or messaging queues. This approach allows for greater scalability, flexibility, and resilience, as services can be developed, deployed, and scaled independently. Microservices also facilitate the use of diverse technologies and languages for different components, and they support continuous delivery and deployment. However, managing microservices involves complexity in terms of inter-service communication, data consistency, and deployment orchestration.

### What is microservices architecture used for?

Typically, microservices are used to speed up application development. Microservices architectures built using Java are common, especially Spring Boot ones. Itâ€™s also common to compare microservices versus service-oriented architecture. Both have the same objective, which is to break up monolithic applications into smaller components, but they have different approaches. Here are some microservices architecture examples:

- **Website migration*
- **Media content**
- **Transactions and invoices**
- **Data processing**

## What are the main components of Microservices Architecture?

Main components of microservices architecture include:

- ****Microservices:**** Small, loosely coupled services that handle specific business functions, each focusing on a distinct capability.
- [****API Gateway:****](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/what-is-api-gateway-system-design/) Acts as a central entry point for external clients also they manage requests, authentication and route the requests to the appropriate microservice.
- [****Service Registry and Discovery:****](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/service-discovery-and-service-registry-in-microservices/) Keeps track of the locations and addresses of all microservices, enabling them to locate and communicate with each other dynamically.
- [****Load Balancer:****](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/load-balancer-system-design-interview-question/) Distributes incoming traffic across multiple service instances and prevent any of the microservice from being overwhelmed.
- [****Containerization****](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/containerization-architecture-in-system-design/)****:**** Docker encapsulate microservices and their dependencies and orchestration tools like Kubernetes manage their deployment and scaling.
- ****Event Bus/****[****Message Broker****](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/what-are-message-brokers-in-system-design/)****:**** Facilitates communication between microservices, allowing pub/sub asynchronous interaction of events between components/microservices.
- [****Database per Microservice****](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/database-per-service-pattern-for-microservices/)****:**** Each microservice usually has its own database, promoting data autonomy and allowing for independent management and scaling.
- [****Caching:****](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/caching-system-design-concept-for-beginners/) Cache stores frequently accessed data close to the microservice which improved performance by reducing the repetitive queries.
- [****Fault Tolerance****](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/fault-tolerance-in-system-design/) ****and**** [****Resilience****](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/resilient-system-system-design/) ****Components:**** Components like [circuit breakers](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/what-is-circuit-breaker-pattern-in-microservices/) and [retry mechanisms](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/retry-pattern-in-microservices/) ensure that the system can handle failures gracefully, maintaining overall functionality.
