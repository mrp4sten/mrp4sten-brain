The Gang of Four (GoF) Design Patterns are a collection of 23 foundational software design patterns that provide solutions to common object-oriented design problems. These patterns are grouped into three categories: _Creational_ (focused on object creation like Singleton and Factory), _Structural_ (focused on class and object composition like Adapter and Composite), and _Behavioral_ (focused on communication between objects like Observer and Strategy). Each pattern offers a proven template for addressing specific design challenges, promoting code reusability, flexibility, and maintainability across software systems.
