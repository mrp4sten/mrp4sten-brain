[[1. Kubernetes]]
Configuration management in Kubernetes (K8s) is the process of defining and managing the configuration of your applications running in a K8s cluster. K8s provides several mechanisms for managing configuration, including ConfigMaps and Secrets, and supports several ways to inject configuration into your applicationâ€™s containers. Configuration management is tightly integrated with other Kubernetes features and is critical for building scalable and reliable applications in Kubernetes.
## ConfigMaps
ConfigMaps are a way to store configuration data that can be used by applications running in the cluster. A Config Map is a key-value store that can hold configuration data such as database URLs, credentials, API keys, or any other application configuration data that can be used by the application.

## Secrets
Kubernetes secrets store sensitive data such as passwords, tokens, and API keys in a secure manner. They can be created manually or automatically, and stored in etcd. Secrets can be mounted as files or environment variables in a pod, and access can be managed using Kubernetes RBAC. However, they have some limitations, such as size and the inability to be updated once created. Understanding secrets is important for building secure applications in Kubernetes.
