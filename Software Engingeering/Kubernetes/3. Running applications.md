[[1. Kubernetes]]

For running application in a Kubernetes cluster, you need to define Kubernetes objects such as Deployment or StatefulSet, Service, and ConfigMap or Secret using YAML files. The Deployment or StatefulSet defines the container image, container ports, and other settings. The Service provides a stable IP address and DNS name to access the application, while the ConfigMap or Secret contains configuration data or sensitive information. To deploy the application, use kubectl apply to create or update the Kubernetes objects. Kubernetes automatically manages the deployment, scaling, and networking of the application based on the YAML files. Monitoring and modification can be done through kubectl commands.
## Pods
In Kubernetes, a pod is the smallest deployable unit that represents a single instance of a running process in a cluster. A pod can contain one or more containers that share the same network namespace and can access the same storage volumes. Pods are created and managed by Kubernetes, and they are scheduled to run on one of the nodes in the cluster. Pods provide a lightweight and flexible abstraction layer that enables Kubernetes to manage the deployment, scaling, and networking of containerized applications. Pods also facilitate the communication and data exchange between containers running in the same pod.

## ReplicaSets
A ReplicaSet is a controller that ensures a specified number of replicas (identical copies) of a pod are running in a cluster at all times. ReplicaSets help to ensure high availability and scalability by automatically scaling the number of pod replicas up or down in response to changes in demand or hardware failures. They are defined by a YAML file that specifies the desired number of replicas, the pod template to use, and other settings. They are responsible for monitoring the status of pods and creating or deleting replicas as necessary to meet the desired state.

## Deployments
A Deployment is a resource object for managing Pods and ReplicaSets via a declarative configuration, which define a desired state that describes the application workload life cycle, number of pods, deployment strategies, container images, and more. The Deployment Controller works to ensure the actual state matches desired state, such as by replacing a failed pod. Out of the box, Deployments support several deployment strategies, like “recreate” and “rolling update”, however can be customized to support more advanced deployment strategies such as blue/green or canary deployments.

## Statefulsets
It is a controller that manages the deployment and scaling of a set of stateful pods that require stable network identities and stable storage volumes. StatefulSets are used to run stateful applications such as databases, where the order and uniqueness of each pod is important. StatefulSets provide unique stable network identities and stable storage volumes for each pod, which allows stateful applications to maintain data consistency even when they are scaled up or down, or when nodes fail or are replaced. StatefulSets are defined by a YAML file that includes a pod template, a service to access the pods, and other settings.

## Jobs
Job is a controller that manages the execution of a finite task or batch job. Jobs are used to run short-lived tasks, such as batch processing, data analysis, or backups, that run to completion and then terminate. Jobs create one or more pods to run the task, and they monitor the completion status of each pod. If a pod fails or terminates, the Job automatically creates a replacement pod to ensure that the task is completed successfully. Jobs are defined by a YAML file that includes a pod template, completion criteria, and other settings.
