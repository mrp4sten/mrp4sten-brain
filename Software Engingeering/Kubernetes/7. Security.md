[[1. Kubernetes]]

Kubernetes (k8s) security involves protecting against potential threats to a clusterâ€™s resources, such as unauthorized access, data breaches, and denial-of-service attacks. This can be achieved through measures such as access controls, network security, encryption, and monitoring. Common tools used for k8s security include Role-Based Access Control (RBAC), Kubernetes Network Policies, TLS certificates, and container image scanning. Regular updates and patches to the k8s environment are also important to maintain security.
## Role based access control
Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) is a method of controlling access to Kubernetes resources based on the roles assigned to users or groups. RBAC involves creating roles and binding them to users or groups to control access to Kubernetes resources. Roles are defined as a set of rules that determine what actions can be performed on specific resources. By assigning roles to users or groups, access to Kubernetes resources can be restricted or granted based on the permissions defined in the role. RBAC helps ensure the security and integrity of Kubernetes clusters by limiting access to authorized users and groups.

## Network security
Network security in Kubernetes involves securing network communication between different components within the cluster and with external networks. This can be achieved through various mechanisms such as Network Policies, Encryption, Authentication, Authorization, and Firewall rules. Network Policies provide fine-grained control over network traffic, while encryption ensures secure communication between pods, nodes, and external systems. Authentication and Authorization mechanisms prevent unauthorized access and provide secure communication between various components. Firewall rules help to protect the cluster against external attacks by limiting access to specific ports and protocols. Overall, network security in Kubernetes is critical to maintaining the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the cluster.
## Container and pod security
Kubernetes (k8s) can secure containers and pods through measures like using trusted container images, limiting container privileges, enforcing pod-level security policies, implementing network security measures, using access controls with RBAC, and managing sensitive information with Secrets and ConfigMaps. These practices help organizations reduce the risk of security incidents in their k8s clusters.
## Security scanners
Kubernetes security scanners help identify vulnerabilities and potential security threats in container images before deployment. Popular options include Aqua Security, Twistlock, Sysdig Secure, Trivy, Anchore Engine, and OpenSCAP. These scanners offer a variety of features such as vulnerability scanning, compliance checks, and runtime protection for Kubernetes environments. By integrating these scanners into their pipelines, organizations can ensure the security and integrity of their Kubernetes deployments and minimize the risk of security breaches and data loss.
