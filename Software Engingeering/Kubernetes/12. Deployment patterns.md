[[1. Kubernetes]]

Deployments is a Kubernetes resource used to declaratively manage the rollout and scaling of application containers across a cluster. Deployments allow teams to define the desired state of a deployment and automatically manage the underlying pods and replica sets to achieve that state. Kubernetes provides various deployment strategies such as RollingUpdate or Canary to control how new versions of an application are rolled out and scaled.
## Helm charts
Helm is a Kubernetes package manager that simplifies the deployment and management of complex applications through the use of reusable and versioned Helm charts. These charts are composed of YAML files that describe related sets of Kubernetes resources and can be customized using values files and templating with Go templates. Helm charts can also have dependencies on other charts and be stored in a centralized repository like Helm Hub for easy sharing and access. By utilizing Helm, teams can streamline application management and reduce duplication of effort.
## GitOps
GitOps is a set of practices for managing infrastructure and applications using Git repositories as the source of truth for declarative configuration. In Kubernetes, GitOps involves using Git as the single source of truth for both the desired and actual state of the system, automating deployment and management tasks, and often using it in conjunction with Continuous Delivery (CD) practices. The result is a more consistent, reliable, and automated approach to managing infrastructure and applications.

## CI/CD Integration
Integrating CI/CD with Kubernetes involves setting up a pipeline to build and deploy your application to a Kubernetes cluster. This process typically includes developing your application code, setting up a source code repository, choosing a CI/CD tool, building a Docker image, pushing the image to a container registry, deploying the application using Kubernetes manifests, and monitoring and troubleshooting the pipeline and deployment as needed.
## Canary deployments
Canary Deployments is a technique used in Kubernetes to gradually roll out new versions of an application by directing a small percentage of users or traffic to the new version while the majority continue using the old version. This approach allows for testing the new version under real-world conditions before fully committing to the update. In Kubernetes, canary deployments can be implemented using tools such as Istio, Linkerd, or Nginx, or by using built-in features like deployment strategies and traffic routing.
## Blue-Green deployments
It is a deployment strategy used in Kubernetes for deploying new versions of an application by running two identical production environments, one with the current version (blue) and the other with the new version (green). After the green environment is fully tested, traffic is routed from the blue environment to the green environment, providing a seamless transition for users and avoiding any downtime or disruption. In Kubernetes, Blue-Green Deployments can be implemented using a variety of tools and techniques, including deployment strategies, traffic routing, and load balancing.
## Rolling updates / rollbacks
Rolling Updates is a deployment strategy in Kubernetes for deploying new versions of an application by gradually updating existing pods with the new version while ensuring that the application remains available throughout the process. Kubernetes allows teams to configure Rolling Updates to update a certain percentage of pods at a time and wait for them to become available before proceeding with the update. In case of any issues, Kubernetes provides a Rollback mechanism, allowing teams to easily revert to the previous version of the application.
