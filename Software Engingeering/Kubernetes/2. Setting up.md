[[1. Kubernetes]]

To set up a Kubernetes cluster, you need to choose a deployment environment, install Kubernetes components on each node, configure networking using a plugin, initialize the master node with kubeadm init, join worker nodes using kubeadm join, deploy applications with manifests, and manage the cluster using kubectl or a management tool

## Installing local cluster
To install and configure a Kubernetes cluster on CentOS 7 or Ubuntu, you would need to setup the prerequisites and requirements for setting up a Kubernetes cluster after which you would be installing the Kubernetes components, including Kubeadm, Kubelet, and Kubectl and then you’ll need to connect the master and the worker nodes. Once the connection is established you can check it by deploying application on the cluster.

## Choosing a managed provider
A managed provider is a cloud-based service that provides a managed Kubernetes environment. This means that the provider handles the underlying infrastructure, such as servers, storage, and networking, as well as the installation, configuration, and maintenance of the Kubernetes cluster.
When choosing a managed Kubernetes provider, consider the cloud provider you are using, features and capabilities, pricing and billing, support, security and compliance, and the provider’s reputation and reviews. By taking these factors into account, you can select a provider that meets your needs and offers the best value for your organization.

## Deploying first application
To deploy your first application in Kubernetes, you need to create a deployment and service manifest in YAML files, apply the manifests to your Kubernetes cluster using the kubectl apply command, verify that your application’s pods are running with kubectl get pods, and test the service with kubectl get services and accessing the service using a web browser or a tool like cURL. There are also various tools and platforms available that can simplify application deployment in Kubernetes, such as Helm charts and Kubernetes operators.
