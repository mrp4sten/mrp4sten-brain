Autoscaling in Kubernetes involves adjusting the resources allocated to a deployment or set of pods based on demand. It includes Horizontal Pod Autoscaling (HPA) and Vertical Pod Autoscaling (VPA), which increase or decrease replicas or adjust resource requests and limits, respectively.
## Horizontal Pod autoscaler
It is a feature in Kubernetes that automatically scales the number of replicas of a pod based on the current demand for the workload it is running.

## Vertical pod autoscaler
Vertical Pod Autoscaler (VPA) is a Kubernetes feature that automates the process of adjusting resource limits for containers in pods. Unlike Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA), which scales the number of replicas of a pod, VPA scales the resources allocated to a pod’s containers.
## Cluster autoscaling
Cluster Autoscaling is a feature in Kubernetes that automatically scales the cluster based on node resource utilization. It monitors the utilization of nodes and creates or removes nodes accordingly to ensure the appropriate amount of resources are available to handle the workload while minimizing costs. There are different approaches to implementing Cluster Autoscaling, such as using Horizontal Pod Autoscaler or Cluster Autoscaler. It’s useful in scenarios with highly variable workloads, ensuring applications remain responsive and available without manual adjustments to the cluster size.
