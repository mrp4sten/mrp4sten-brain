Monitoring in k8s involves keeping an eye on the health and performance of the cluster and its components. This includes monitoring the usage and availability of resources such as CPU, memory, and storage, as well as the status of the k8s services and nodes. Some popular monitoring solutions for k8s include Prometheus, Grafana, and Datadog.
Logging in k8s involves collecting and analyzing the logs generated by the various components in the cluster, such as the applications, pods, and nodes. These logs can provide insights into the behavior and performance of the cluster, and can also help with troubleshooting issues. Some popular logging solutions for k8s include Fluentd, Elasticsearch, and Kibana.

## Resource health
Resource health monitoring in Kubernetes involves monitoring the health and availability of resources such as pods, nodes, and containers. It helps administrators identify and troubleshoot issues that may affect the systemâ€™s performance and availability using tools such as Kubernetes Dashboard, Prometheus, or Grafana. Resource health monitoring also helps ensure that the system is resilient to failures and can recover quickly from any disruptions. It is an important part of managing a Kubernetes cluster and ensures the reliability, availability, and scalability of the system.
## Observability engines
Observability in Kubernetes (k8s) refers to the ability to gain insight into the inner workings of your cluster, applications, and services running on top of it. An observability engine in k8s is a tool or platform that facilitates the collection, analysis, and visualization of data from various sources in your k8s environment. Some popular observability engines in k8s include Prometheus, Grafana, Jaeger, and Elastic Stack (ELK).
## Logs
Logs are generated by containerized applications running on nodes within the cluster. You can access these logs using the kubectl logs command followed by the name of the pod. By default, this command shows the logs from the most recent container in the pod, but you can specify a specific container within the pod by adding the container name to the command.

## Metrics
Metrics to monitor include CPU usage, memory usage, network usage, disk usage, API server metrics, pod and container metrics, and cluster-level metrics.

## Traces
Tracing in Kubernetes involves monitoring the flow of requests through different components of the system, using tools such as Jaeger or Zipkin. OpenTracing and OpenCensus provide a consistent way of capturing traces across different components and applications running on the cluster.
