Kubernetes, also known as k8s, is an open-source container orchestration platform that automates the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications.
## What is kubernetes?
Kubernetes is a portable, extensible, open source platform for managing containerized workloads and services, that facilitates both declarative configuration and automation. It has a large, rapidly growing ecosystem. Kubernetes services, support, and tools are widely available.
## Why kubernetes
Kubernetes (k8s) is needed because it provides a powerful and flexible platform for deploying and managing containerized applications at scale. It allows for easy scalability, high resilience, application portability, automation of many tasks, and standardization of the container platform. k8s also helps reduce complexity and workload for operations teams, enabling them to focus on more strategic initiatives.
## Key concepts and terminologies
- Cluster Architecture: The architectural concepts behind Kubernetes.
- Containers: Technology for packaging an application along with its runtime dependencies.
- Workloads: Understand Pods, the smallest deployable compute object in Kubernetes, and the higher-level abstractions that help you to run them.
- Services, Load Balancing, and Networking: Concepts and resources behind networking in Kubernetes.
- Storage: Ways to provide both long-term and temporary storage to Pods in your cluster.
- Configuration: Resources that Kubernetes provides for configuring Pods.
- Cluster Administration: Lower-level detail relevant to creating or administering a Kubernetes cluster.
## Alternatives
Kubernetes is a popular open-source container orchestration tool that is widely used for managing and deploying containerized applications. While there are other container orchestration tools available, such as Docker Swarm, Mesos, and Nomad, there are some key differences between Kubernetes and these other tools and some of them a. re mentioned below:
- Architecture: Kubernetes is designed as a modular system with many components that work together to provide container orchestration, such as the Kubernetes API server, kubelet, kube-proxy, and etcd.
- Scalability: Kubernetes is designed to handle large-scale deployments and can scale applications up or down based on demand.
- Flexibility: Kubernetes is highly configurable and can be customized to meet specific requirements, whereas other container orchestration tools may have more limited configuration options.
- Portability: Kubernetes is designed to be cloud-agnostic and can run on any public or private cloud platform, as well as on-premises.
- Community: Kubernetes has a large and active community of developers and users who contribute to its development and provide support.
