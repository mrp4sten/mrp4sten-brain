Spring Boot’s Autoconfiguration is a powerful and convenient feature that makes it easy to configure beans and other components in your application based on the presence of certain dependencies and properties. It saves developer’s time by reducing the need for boilerplate configuration code, and can be fine-tuned through properties and annotations, to provide a fine-grained control over the auto-configurations.
