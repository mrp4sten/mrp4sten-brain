Spring Boot’s Embedded Server feature is a convenient and powerful feature that allows you to run a web server directly within your application, without the need to deploy it to a separate standalone web server. This makes it easy to develop, test, and deploy web applications, and it’s also lightweight, easy to start and stop, and easy to configure.
