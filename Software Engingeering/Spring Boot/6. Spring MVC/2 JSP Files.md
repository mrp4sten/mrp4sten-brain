# JSP Files

JSP (JavaServer Pages) is a technology for building dynamic web pages using Java.

In a Spring MVC application that uses JSPs, the view component of the MVC pattern is implemented using JSP files. The JSP files contain the presentation logic for the application and are responsible for generating the HTML that is sent to the clientâ€™s web browser. When a user makes a request to a Spring MVC application, the DispatcherServlet, which acts as the front controller, handles the request and delegates responsibility for generating the response to the appropriate JSP file.
