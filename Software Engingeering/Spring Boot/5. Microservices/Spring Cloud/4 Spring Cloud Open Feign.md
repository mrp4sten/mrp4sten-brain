# Spring Cloud OpenFeign

Spring Cloud OpenFeign is a library for creating declarative REST clients in Spring applications. It allows developers to easily make HTTP requests to other microservices or remote services, without having to manually write the low-level code to handle the requests and responses. OpenFeign is built on top of the OpenFeign declarative HTTP client, which is a simple, lightweight library for creating HTTP clients in Java.
