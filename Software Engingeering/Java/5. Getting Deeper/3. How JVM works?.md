## Description 
The JVM has two primary functions: to allow Java programs to run on any device or operating system (known as the “write once, run anywhere” principle), and to manage and optimize program memory

The **Java Virtual Machine (JVM)** is a key component of the Java ecosystem that **runs Java programs** by converting **bytecode** (compiled Java code) into **machine code**
### **Main Components of the JVM:**

1. **ClassLoader**:
    - Loads Java **classes** into the JVM at runtime.
    - Responsible for finding, verifying, and loading the required classes.
2. **Runtime Data Areas (Memory Management):**
    - **Heap**: Stores **objects** and **class instances**.
    - **Stack**: Stores **method calls** and local variables.
    - **Method Area**: Contains **class metadata**, including bytecode and static variables.
    - **PC Register**: Tracks the **address** of the next instruction.
    - **Native Method Stack**: Manages **native (non-Java) code** execution.
3. **Execution Engine**:
    - Executes the **bytecode** using:
        - **Interpreter**: Converts bytecode to machine code **line-by-line** (slow).
        - **Just-In-Time (JIT) Compiler**: Converts frequently executed code **into native code** for better performance.
4. **Garbage Collector (GC):**
    - Automatically **manages memory** by deallocating objects that are no longer used, preventing memory leaks.
5. **Native Interface**:
    - Allows interaction with **native libraries** (non-Java code like C/C++) through the **Java Native Interface (JNI)**.
### **How the JVM Executes a Java Program:**

1. **Compilation**: Java code is compiled to **bytecode** by the `javac` compiler.
2. **Class Loading**: The **ClassLoader** loads the bytecode into the JVM.
3. **Execution**: The **Execution Engine** interprets or JIT-compiles the bytecode to native machine code.
4. **Memory Management**: The **Garbage Collector** monitors and reclaims unused memory.
