## Description 
Java garbage collection is the process by which Java programs perform automatic memory management.
Java garbage collection is an automatic process. The programmer does not need to explicitly mark objects to be deleted. The garbage collection implementation lives in the JVM. Every JVM can implement garbage collection however it pleases. The only requirement is that it should meet the JVM specification.

- **Young Generation**: Newly created objects start in the Young Generation. The garbage collector further subdivides Young Generation into an Eden space, where all new objects start, and two Survivor spaces, where it moves objects from Eden after surviving one garbage collection cycle. When objects are garbage collected from the Young Generation, it is a minor garbage collection event.
- **Old Generation:** Eventually, the garbage collector moves the long-lived objects from the Young Generation to the Old Generation. When objects are garbage collected from the Old Generation, it is a major garbage collection event.
- **Permanent Generation:** The JVM stores the metadata, such as classes and methods, in the Permanent Generation. JVM garbage collects the classes from the Permanent Generation that are no longer in use.
### **Garbage Collectors in Java:**

1. **Serial GC** (Single-threaded):  
    Simple, but pauses the application (good for small apps).  
    `-XX:+UseSerialGC`
2. **Parallel GC** (Multi-threaded):  
    Performs GC in parallel to improve throughput.  
    `-XX:+UseParallelGC`
3. **G1 (Garbage First) GC**:  
    Splits the heap into **regions** and collects in smaller batches. Good for **low-latency** applications.  
    `-XX:+UseG1GC`
4. **ZGC**:  
    Aims for **ultra-low pause times** even on very large heaps.  
    `-XX:+UseZGC`
5. **Shenandoah GC**:  
    Another **low-pause-time** GC focused on large-scale applications.  
    `-XX:+UseShenandoahGC`
