## Description
Is the process of allocation and de-allocation of objects, called memory management. Java does memory management automatically. Java uses an automatic memory management system called **Garbage collection**. Thus we are not required to implement memory management logic in our application. 

### JVM Memory structure
![[memory-management-in-java.png]]
JVM creates various run time data areas in a heap. These areas are used during the program execution. The memory areas are destroyed when JVM exits, whereas the data areas are destroyed when the thread exits.

#### Method Area
Is a part of a heap memory which is shared among all the threads. It creates when the JVM starts up. It's used to store class structure, superclass name, interface name and constructors. 
JVM stores the following kinds of information in the method area: 
- A Fully qualified name of a type (ex: String)
- The type's modifiers
- Type's direct superclass name
- A structured list of the fully qualified names of super interfaces.
#### Heap Area
Stores the actual objects. Also it creates when JVM starts up. The user can control the heap if needed. It can be fixed or dynamic size. When you use a new keyword, the JVM creates an instance for the object in a heap. While the reference of that object stores in the stack Exists only on heap for each running JVM process. 
Is divided into following parts: 
- Young generation
- Survivor space
- Old generation
- Permanent generation
- Code Cache
##### Reference type
- **Strong**: Any object which has a strong reference method attached to it is not eligible for garbage collection
```java
StringBuilder sb= new StringBuilder();  
```
- **Weak**: It doesn't survive after the next garbage collection process. If we are not sure when the data will be requested again. In this condition we can create a weak reference: 
```java
WeakReference<StringBuilder> reference = new WeakReference<>(new StringBuilder());  
```
- **Sort**: It's collected when the application is running low on memory. We can create this a sort reference If we want to cache objects but allow the JVM to clean them up if it needs memory or when we are dealing with a large amount of data. 
```java
SoftReference<StringBuilder> reference = new SoftReference<>(new StringBuilder());  
```
- **Phantom**: The object which has only phantom reference pointing them can be collected whenever garbage collector wants to collect. We can make this reference when we need to track when an object has been collected, Used in conjunction with **ReferenceQueue** to detect objects removal and perform custom cleanup logic. Or  when we want more control than **finalize()**
```java
PhantomReference<StringBuilder> reference = new PhantomReference<>(new StringBuilder());  
```
#### Stack Area
Generates when a thread creates. It can be of either fixed or dynamic size. Is allocated per thread. It is used to store data and partial results. Contains references to heap objects. 
#### Native Method stack 
Also known as C stack. It is a stack for native code written in a language other tan Java. Java Natives Interface (**JNI**) calls the native stack. 
#### PC Registers
Each thread has a program counter (**PC**) register associated with it. PC register stores the return address or a native pointer. It also contains the address of the JVM instructions currently beign executed.
