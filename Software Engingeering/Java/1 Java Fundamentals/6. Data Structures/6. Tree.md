## Key points
- Is defined as a collection of objects or entities known as nodes that are linked together to represent or simulate hierarchy.
- Is non-linear data structure. Is recursive data structure because the distinguished node in a tree is known as a  root node 
- The topmost node is known as a root node. Each node contains some data, and data can be of any data type. 
- Each node contains some data and the link of other nodes that can be called children.

## Application 
- Storing naturally hierarchical data.
- Organize data 
- Heap 
- Routing table
- B - Tree and B + Tree
## Types of Tree
### General tree

### Binary tree
In a binary tree each node in a tree can have utmost two child nodes. Here utmost means whether the node has 0 nodes, 1 node or 2 nodes.

### Binary search tree
Is non-linear data structure in which one node is connected to **n** number of nodes
