## How java works?

![[how-it-works?.jpg]]

### Example main class
```java
// Every line of code that runs in Java must be inside a `class`
// A class should always start with an uppercase first letter
public class Main { 
// The `main()` method is required and you will see it in every Java program:
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    System.out.println("Hello World");
  }
}
```

> **Note:** Java is case-sensitive: "MyClass" and "myclass" has different meaning.
