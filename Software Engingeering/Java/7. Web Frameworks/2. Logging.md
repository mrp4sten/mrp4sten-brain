## Description 
Logging is an important feature that helps developers to trace out the errors. It provides the ability to capture the log file. Logging provides the complete tracing information of the application and also records the critical failure if any occur in an application. There are three components of Logging: Logger, Logging handlers or Appenders and Layouts or logging formatters.

## Log4j2
**Log4j2** is a powerful, flexible, and feature-rich logging library for Java applications. It is part of the Apache Logging Services and is the successor to the original Log4j framework. Log4j2 provides a robust framework for logging, with improved performance, easier configuration, and enhanced functionality compared to its predecessor.
```java
import org.apache.logging.log4j.LogManager;
import org.apache.logging.log4j.Logger;

public class Main {
    private static final Logger logger = LogManager.getLogger(Main.class);

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        logger.debug("Debug message");
        logger.info("Info message");
        logger.warn("Warning message");
        logger.error("Error message");
        logger.fatal("Fatal message");
    }
}
```

## Logback
**Logback** is a popular Java-based logging framework that serves as a successor to the older Log4j framework. It is widely used in various Java applications due to its efficiency, flexibility, and rich features. Logback is designed to be reliable, fast, and capable of handling the needs of enterprise-level applications. It is also the native logging framework for the Spring Framework, which means it integrates seamlessly with Spring applications.
```java
import org.slf4j.Logger;
import org.slf4j.LoggerFactory;

public class Main {
    private static final Logger logger = LoggerFactory.getLogger(Main.class);

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        logger.debug("Debug message");
        logger.info("Info message");
        logger.warn("Warning message");
        logger.error("Error message");
        logger.trace("Trace message");
    }
}
```

## SLF4J
**SLF4J** (Simple Logging Facade for Java) is a simple logging abstraction for Java that serves as a facade for various logging frameworks (like Log4j, Logback, Java Util Logging, etc.). It allows developers to write logging code without being tied to a specific logging implementation, making it easier to switch logging frameworks or even use multiple frameworks simultaneously.
```java
import org.slf4j.Logger;
import org.slf4j.LoggerFactory;

public class Main {
    private static final Logger logger = LoggerFactory.getLogger(Main.class);

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String name = "Alice";
        int age = 30;

        // Parameterized logging
        logger.debug("Debug message: name={}, age={}", name, age);
        logger.info("Info message: name={}, age={}", name, age);
        logger.warn("Warning message: name={}, age={}", name, age);
        logger.error("Error message: name={}, age={}", name, age);
        logger.trace("Trace message: name={}, age={}", name, age);
    }
}
```

## TinyLog
**TinyLog** is a lightweight logging framework for Java that is designed to be simple and efficient. Its primary focus is on minimalism, ease of use, and high performance. TinyLog is particularly suitable for applications where logging requirements are straightforward and do not necessitate the advanced features provided by more complex logging frameworks.
```java
import org.tinylog.Logger;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Logger.info("Application started");

        String user = "Alice";
        int age = 30;

        // Log messages with different levels
        Logger.debug("Debug message: User={}, Age={}", user, age);
        Logger.warn("Warning message: User={}, Age={}", user, age);
        Logger.error("Error message: User={}, Age={}", user, age);
        
        Logger.info("Application finished");
    }
}
```
