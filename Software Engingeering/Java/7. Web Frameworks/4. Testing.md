A key to building software that meets requirements without defects is testing. Software testing helps developers know they are building the right software. When tests are run as part of the development process (often with continuous integration tools), they build confidence and prevent regressions in the code.

## Unit Testing
**Unit Testing** is a software testing technique where individual components or modules of a program are tested in isolation from the rest of the application. The main goal is to validate that each unit of the software performs as expected. Unit testing is typically performed by developers during the coding phase, allowing them to identify and fix bugs early in the development process.
### Key Features of Unit Testing
1. **Isolation**: Each unit test focuses on a single part of the codebase (usually a function or method) to ensure it behaves correctly under various conditions.
2. **Automation**: Unit tests can be automated, which allows for rapid and consistent execution of tests every time the code is changed.
3. **Early Bug Detection**: By testing components individually, developers can identify bugs earlier in the development lifecycle, reducing the cost and effort required to fix them.
4. **Documentation**: Unit tests serve as documentation for the codebase. They describe how functions and methods are expected to behave, making it easier for new developers to understand the code.
5. **Facilitates Refactoring**: With a solid suite of unit tests, developers can confidently refactor code, knowing that if something breaks, the tests will catch it.
6. **Improves Code Quality**: Writing unit tests often encourages developers to write cleaner, more modular, and more maintainable code.

## Integration Testing 
**Integration Testing** is a software testing phase in which individual components or systems are combined and tested as a group. The goal of integration testing is to identify issues that occur when different modules or services interact with each other, ensuring that they work together as expected.
### Key Features of Integration Testing
1. **Component Interaction**: Focuses on the interactions between integrated components, modules, or systems to ensure they work together correctly.
2. **Detecting Interface Issues**: Helps identify problems with data exchange and communication between modules, such as incorrect API calls, message formats, or database interactions.
3. **Testing the Workflow**: Verifies that the combined behavior of modules produces the expected outcomes in various scenarios.
4. **Complex Scenarios**: Allows for testing of more complex scenarios that involve multiple components working together, which may not be covered in unit tests.
5. **Supports Continuous Integration**: Integration tests are often automated and run frequently, allowing for early detection of integration issues in a continuous integration (CI) environment.
### Types of Integration Testing
1. **Big Bang Integration Testing**: All components are integrated simultaneously, and the entire system is tested at once. This approach can make it challenging to identify the source of defects.
2. **Top-Down Integration Testing**: Testing starts from the top level of the application and progresses downward. Stubs are used to simulate lower-level components that are not yet integrated.
3. **Bottom-Up Integration Testing**: Testing starts from the lower-level components and works upward. Drivers are used to simulate higher-level components that are not yet integrated.
4. **Incremental Integration Testing**: Components are integrated and tested incrementally. This approach can be either top-down or bottom-up.
5. **Continuous Integration Testing**: Automated integration tests are executed regularly, often with each build, to catch integration issues as early as possible.
### Rest assured
Testing and validating REST services in Java is harder than in dynamic languages such as Ruby and Groovy. REST Assured brings the simplicity of using these languages into the Java domain.

### JMeter
Apache JMeter is an Apache project that can be used as a load testing tool for analyzing and measuring the performance of a variety of services, with a focus on web applications.

## Mocking > Mockito
Mocking removes external dependencies from a unit test to create a sense of an entire controlled environment. The traditional method of mocks involves mocking all other classes that interact with the class we want to test. The common targets for mocking are:
- Database connections
- Web services
- Slow Classes
- Classes with side effects
- Classes with non-deterministic behavior

## Behavior Testing 
**Behavior Testing** (often referred to as **Behavior-Driven Development** or BDD) is a software development approach that emphasizes collaboration among developers, QA, and non-technical stakeholders (like business analysts and product owners) to define and validate the behavior of a system. The goal of behavior testing is to ensure that the software meets the expected behavior as specified by the stakeholders and that it functions as intended in real-world scenarios.
### Key Features of Behavior Testing

1. **Collaboration**: BDD encourages collaboration among all stakeholders to define the expected behavior of the application in a language that everyone can understand. This often involves writing specifications in natural language.
2. **User-Centric**: Focuses on the user's perspective, ensuring that the software meets user needs and requirements.
3. **Living Documentation**: Specifications are written in a way that serves as both documentation and automated tests. This helps keep the documentation up to date with the actual behavior of the application.
4. **Test Automation**: Behavior tests are typically automated, allowing for regular verification of the application's behavior during development.
5. **Acceptance Criteria**: Defines clear acceptance criteria for features, making it easier to verify that a feature is complete and works as expected.
### Cucumber JVM 
Cucumber is a testing tool that supports Behavior Driven Development (BDD). It offers a way to write tests that anybody can understand, regardless of their technical knowledge.

### Cukes
cukes-rest takes simplicity of Cucumber and provides bindings for HTTP specification. As a sugar on top, cukes-rest adds steps for storing and using request/response content from a file system, variable support in .features, context inflation in all steps and a custom plug-in system to allow users to add additional project specific content.

### JBehave
Behave is a framework for Behaviour-Driven Development (BDD). BDD is an evolution of test-driven development (TDD) and acceptance-test driven design, and is intended to make these practices more accessible and intuitive to newcomers and experts alike. It shifts the vocabulary from being test-based to behaviour-based, and positions itself as a design philosophy.
