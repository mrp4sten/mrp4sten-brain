A REST API (Representational State Transfer Application Programming Interface) is an architectural style for designing networked applications. It relies on standard HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) to interact with resources, which are represented as URIs (Uniform Resource Identifiers). REST APIs are stateless, meaning each request from a client to a server must contain all the information needed to understand and process the request. They use standard HTTP status codes to indicate the outcome of requests and often communicate in formats like JSON or XML. REST APIs are widely used due to their simplicity, scalability, and ease of integration with web services and applications.
