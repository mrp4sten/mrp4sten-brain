An API (Application Programming Interface) is a set of defined rules and protocols that allow different software applications to communicate and interact with each other. It provides a standardized way for developers to access and manipulate the functionalities or data of a service, application, or platform without needing to understand its internal workings. APIs can be public or private and are commonly used to integrate disparate systems, facilitate third-party development, and enable interoperability between applications. They typically include endpoints, request methods (like GET, POST, PUT), and data formats (like JSON or XML) to interact with.
