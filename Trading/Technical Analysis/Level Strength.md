**Level Strength** refers to the significance and reliability of support and resistance levels in technical analysis. Strong levels are more likely to cause price reversals or pauses, whereas weak levels might be easily breached.

### Key Factors Determining Level Strength:

1. **Number of Touches**:
    - **Definition**: The more times a price level is tested (touched) without being breached, the stronger it becomes.
    - **Implication**: Frequent tests of a level indicate its importance as a support or resistance.
2. **Volume**:
    - **Definition**: The trading volume associated with the price level.
    - **Implication**: High volume at a level suggests strong market interest and reinforces the levelâ€™s significance.
3. **Duration**:
    - **Definition**: The length of time a level has held without being breached.
    - **Implication**: Levels that have held for longer periods are generally stronger and more reliable.
4. **Historical Significance**:
    - **Definition**: The importance of the level in past price action.
    - **Implication**: Levels that have historically caused significant price reversals are considered strong.
5. **Market Context**:
    - **Definition**: The broader market conditions and trends around the level.
    - **Implication**: Levels aligned with major trends or patterns (e.g., trendlines, moving averages) tend to be stronger.
