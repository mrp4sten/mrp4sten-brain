**Level Breaks** in trading refer to instances when the price of an asset moves beyond established support or resistance levels.

### Key concepts

1. **Support Level Breaks**:
    - **Definition**: When the price falls below a support level.
    - **Implication**: Indicates increased selling pressure and potential for further decline.
    - **Behavior**: What was previously a support level can become a new resistance level.
    - **Strategy**: Traders might sell or short-sell upon confirmation of the break.
2. **Resistance Level Breaks**:
    - **Definition**: When the price rises above a resistance level.
    - **Implication**: Indicates increased buying pressure and potential for further rise.
    - **Behavior**: What was previously a resistance level can become a new support level.
    - **Strategy**: Traders might buy or go long upon confirmation of the break.

### Confirmation:

- **Volume**: High trading volume during a break often confirms the validity of the level break.
- **Retest**: The price may return to the broken level to test it as a new support or resistance before continuing in the direction of the break.

### False Breaks (Fakeouts):

- **Definition**: When the price moves beyond a level but quickly reverses back.
- **Implication**: Can trap traders who enter positions based on the perceived break.
- **Strategy**: Traders use confirmation techniques, such as waiting for a retest or increased volume, to avoid false breaks.
