## Description 
Is a mechanism of writing the state of an object into a byte-stream. It is mainly used in **Hibernate**, **RMI**, **JPA**, **EJB**, and JVMs technologies. 
The reverse operation of serialization is called deserialization where byte-stream is converted into an object. The serialization and deserialization process is platform-independent, it means you can serialize an object on one platform and deserialize it on a different platform.
