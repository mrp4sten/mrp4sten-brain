# Description

A data structure is the way to store and organize data on memory. Is not a programming language It is set of algorithms that we can use in any programming language to structure data in memory.

To structure the data in memory, 'n' numbers of algorithms were proposed, and all these algorithms are known as abstract data types.

## Type of Data Structures
- **Primitive**: Are primitive data types, The int, char, float, double, and pointer are the primitive data structures, that can hold a single value
- **Non-primitive**:Is divided in two types
	- **Linear**: The arrangement of data in a sequential manner  is known  as linear  data structure (e.g array)
	- **Non-linear**: Elements is connected to the 'n'  number of elements (random manner e.g. graphs, trees)

Data structures  can also be classified as: 
- **Static**: The size is allocated at the compile time, therefore the maximum size is fixed
- **Dynamic**: The size is allocated at the runtime, therefore the maximum size is flexible 
## Common / Major Operations
- Searching
- Sorting
- Insertion
- Update
- Delete
## Advantages
- Efficiency
- Re usability
- Abstraction
