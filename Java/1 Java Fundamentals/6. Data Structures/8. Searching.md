## Linear searching
Also called as sequential search algorithm. In linear search we simply traverse the list completely and and match each element of the list with the item whose location is to be found. If the match is found, then the location of the item is returned, otherwise the algorithm return NULL.

## Binary search
Is the search technique that works efficiently on sorted lists. Hence to search an element into some list using the binary search technique, we must ensured that the list is sorted. 
Follows the divide and conquer approach in which the list is divided into two halves, and the item is compared with the middle element of the list. If the match is found then, the location of the middle item is returned. Otherwise, we search into either of the halves depending upon the result produced through the match.
