### Doubly linked list![[doubly-linked-list.png]]
A node contains a pointer to the previous as well as the next node in the sequence

### Circular singly list 
- The last node of the list contains a pointer to the first node of the list. We can have a circular singly list as well as circular doubly linked list

### Circular doubly linked list
A node contains pointer to the previous node as well at the next node. This doesn't contain null in any of the nodes. The last node of the list contains the address of the first node of the list. And first node also contain the address to the last node in the previous pointer.
